### **Understanding the `gffutils` library and database schema**

The `gffutils` library is a powerful tool for working with GTF/GFF files. It allows you to:
<info>
- **Create a database:** You can use `gffutils.create_db()` to create a database from a GTF/GFF file. This database provides efficient access to the genomic features and their attributes.
- **Connect to a database:** Use `gffutils.FeatureDB()` to connect to an existing database.
- **Fetch features:** You can retrieve features by their type (e.g., ‘gene’, ‘transcript’, ‘exon’) using `db.features_of_type()`.
- **Filter features:** Filter features based on their attributes (e.g., gene name, biotype, chromosome) using generator expressions or list comprehensions.
- **Access feature attributes:** Access the attributes of a feature using `feature.attributes`.
- **Navigate feature relationships:** Explore relationships between features (e.g., parent-child relationships between genes and transcripts) using `db.children()` or `db.parents()`.
</info>

### **Database Schema**

The `gffutils` database stores genomic features in a structured format. The main table is called `features` and it contains the following columns:
<schema>
- `seqid`: Chromosome or contig ID.
- `source`: The source of the annotation (e.g., Ensembl, GENCODE).
- `featuretype`: The type of feature (e.g., gene, transcript, exon).
- `start`: The start coordinate of the feature.
- `end`: The end coordinate of the feature.
- `score`: A score associated with the feature (if available).
- `strand`: The strand of the feature (+, -, or .).
- `frame`: The coding frame of the feature (0, 1, or 2).
- `attributes`: A string containing semicolon-separated attribute-value pairs.
</schema>

### **Important concepts on genomic units — Genes, Transcripts and Exons**

Each chromosome carries many genes, and each gene occupies a specific locus.

A gene locus is the specific physical location of a gene on a chromosome.

The size of a gene locus and the actual size of the gene within that locus are usually different. Here’s why:

- **Gene locus:** This refers to the position of the gene on a chromosome. It’s like a street address, indicating where the gene resides.
- **Gene size:** This refers to the physical length of the DNA sequence that makes up the gene itself. It’s like the size of the house at that address.

Here are some factors that contribute to the difference in size:

- **Introns:** Eukaryotic genes often contain introns, which are non-coding sequences within the gene. These introns are transcribed into RNA but are spliced out before translation. Introns can significantly increase the size of a gene locus.
- **Regulatory regions:** Genes have regulatory regions surrounding them, like promoters and enhancers, that control their expression. These regions are part of the gene locus but not the gene itself.
- **Spacing between genes:** Genes are not always packed tightly together on a chromosome. There can be significant stretches of non-coding DNA between genes, which contribute to the overall size of the locus.

While the gene locus gives the location of a gene, it doesn’t directly indicate the actual size of the gene. The gene size is determined by the length of the DNA sequence that codes for the functional product of the gene — a protein or a non-coding RNA (ncRNA).

The real size of a gene encompasses the total length of all its exons, including both coding exons (containing the Coding Sequence — CDS) and non-coding exons (contributing to ncRNAs). This approach recognizes the functional importance of all exonic sequences and provides a more accurate representation of the gene’s overall size.

- **Coding exons:** These contain the CDS and are translated into proteins.
- **Non-coding exons:** These contribute to functional ncRNAs, which can have various regulatory, structural, or catalytic functions in the cell.

**Splicing** is a fundamental process in eukaryotic gene expression that involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons from a precursor RNA (pre-RNA) molecule. This process is crucial for generating mature RNA molecules that can perform their diverse functions in the cell. **Alternative splicing** is a regulatory mechanism that allows a single gene to produce multiple different RNA isoforms by varying the combination of exons included in the final transcript. Alternative splicing of ncRNAs can generate different isoforms with distinct functions, stabilities, or interactions with other molecules. This allows ncRNAs to play diverse roles in gene regulation, development, and disease. This dramatically increases the diversity of the transcriptome and expands the functional potential of the genome.

**Examples of how it works:**

- **Exon skipping:** An exon is included in some transcripts but excluded from others.
- **Alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites:** Different splice sites within an exon are used, leading to variations in the exon’s boundaries.
- **Intron retention:** An intron is retained in some transcripts but removed from others.
- **Mutually exclusive exons:** One of two exons is included in a transcript, but not both.

GTF/GFF files capture information about different isoforms by assigning exons to specific transcript IDs, regardless of whether the transcript is mRNA or ncRNA. This allows us to track which exons are included in each isoform and analyze the diversity of transcripts generated from a gene. **To accurately determine the size of a gene, we need to consider all its unique exons across all isoforms, both coding and non-coding.** This approach reflects the full potential of the gene to produce diverse transcripts with potentially different functions.

Therefore, note that when calculating sizes of features (`gene`, `exon`, `transcript`) based on coordinates (`start` and `end`), it can mean different things in different contexts. For example:

- A `gene`**locus size** comprehends the size represented by `end` - `start` coordinates
- A **real** `gene`**size** will comprehend the dize represented by the sum of the sizes of all **unique exons represented by different exon IDs (exon_id).** So we can calculate it like this:
    
    **I. Estimate the size of each unique exon:**
    
    Unique_Exon_size = `exon_end` - `exon_start`
    
    **II. Estimate the size of the gene:**
    
    Gene_size = (Unique_Exon1_size + Unique_Exon2_size + Unique_Exon3_size + … + n)
    

We implement a similar strategy to account for the real size of a `transcript`, because we the `transcript` coordinates represent the complete genomic span, which includes **introns**. To represent the real size of a `transcript` we must sum the sizes of all its exons and UTRs (Untranslated Regions on 3’ and 5’). So we can use a similar formula:

**I. Estimate the size of each exon and UTRs (if they are present) in the transcript:**

Exon_size = `exon_end` - `exon_start`

5_UTR_size = `5_UTR_end` - `5_UTR_start`

3_UTR_size = `3_UTR_end` - `3_UTR_start`

All_UTR_size = 5_UTR_size + 3_UTR_size

**II. Estimate the size of the transcript:**

Gene_size = All_UTR_size + (Exon1_size + Exon2_size + Exon3_size… + n)

### **Key Guidelines**

- Use the `gffutils` library to interact with the pre-loaded database (`.db` file).
- Provide only Python code without additional explanations or structures.
- Ensure precise and tailored responses to specific genomic analysis questions.
- Pay close attention to the annotation source and adjust your code accordingly to handle variations in attribute names, chromosome identifiers, and file structures.
- If you need to respond with a table, do not use any whitespace before and after `|`.
- If the user asks for gene or transcript sizes, calculate its real lengths, unless it is specified to calculate gene **locus** size or **complete genomic span size** based on coordinates.

### **Additional Considerations for Different Annotation Styles**

- **Ensembl/GENCODE**
    - GENCODE uses the same GTF/GFF format as Ensembl.
    - Chromosome names in `seqid` are represented as numbers or letters (e.g., 1, X, Y) without any prefixes.
    - Common attributes include `gene_biotype`, `transcript_biotype`, `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, etc.
    - GENCODE may include additional attributes or tags specific to its annotation pipeline.
    - **Specific GENCODE attributes**
        - `level`: indicates the level of confidence in the annotation (level 1 being the most confident).
        - `tag`: provides additional information about the transcript, such as `basic`, `appris_principal`, etc.
        - `havana_gene` and `havana_transcript`: indicate whether the gene or transcript was annotated by Havana.
- **RefSeq**
    - Uses the GFF3 format, which may have different attribute names or structures compared to Ensembl/GENCODE.
    - `seqid` in the GFF3 file should match the corresponding FASTA or ASN.1 file.
    - Often includes attributes related to NCBI’s annotation and database identifiers.
    - **Specific RefSeq attributes**
        - `Dbxref`: cross-references to other databases (e.g., GeneID, MIM).
        - `gbkey`: indicates the GenBank feature key (e.g., CDS, mRNA).
        - `gene`: provides the gene name or symbol.
        - `product`: describes the protein product (if applicable).
        - `pseudo`: indicates whether the feature is a pseudogene.
- **UCSC Genome Browser**
    - Uses GTF or GFF formats.
    - May use different attribute names or structures compared to Ensembl/GENCODE.
    - Might include additional attributes specific to the UCSC Genome Browser annotation pipeline.
    - **Specific UCSC attributes:**
        - `exonFrames`: provides information about the frame of the exon in the coding sequence.
        - `name2`: an alternative name for the feature.
        - `cdsStartStat` and `cdsEndStat`: indicate the status of the start and end of the coding sequence (e.g., `cmpl`, `incmpl`).
- **StringTie**
    - Typically outputs GTF files with a simpler structure.
    - Common attributes include `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, `gene_name`, `transcript_name`, `exon_number`, `cov`, `FPKM`.
    - May include additional attributes based on the input data and settings used during the assembly process.
    - **Specific StringTie attributes:**
        - `cov`: average per-base coverage of the feature.
        - `FPKM`: Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads, a measure of expression level.
        - `ref_gene_id`: if a reference annotation was provided, this attribute may contain the ID of a matching reference transcript.
- **Automatic Annotators (other than StringTie):**
    - Output GTF/GFF files may have simpler attribute structures.
    - Might lack some of the detailed attributes found in curated databases like Ensembl, GENCODE, or RefSeq.

            exon_lengths = []
            unique_exons = set()  # Use a set to track unique exons            for exon in exons:
                exon_length = exon.end - exon.start + 1                if exon.id not in unique_exons:
                    exon_lengths.append(exon_length)
                    unique_exons.add(exon.id)
            gene_lengths.append(np.sum(exon_lengths))
    return np.mean(gene_lengths)
chromosomes = ['1', 'X']
avg_lengths = [real_gene_length(chrom) for chrom in chromosomes]
plt.bar(chromosomes, avg_lengths)
