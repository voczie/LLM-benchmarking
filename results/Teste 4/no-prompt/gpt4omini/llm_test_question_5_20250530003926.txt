To find the gene that precedes `COL1A2` and is on the same strand, you can follow these steps using Python and the SQLite3 database containing your genome annotation data. Below is a walkthrough along with the necessary code.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Retrieve the `COL1A2` Gene**: First, you need to find the `COL1A2` gene in the database to get its details, including its chromosome and strand.

2. **Find Genes on the Same Strand**: Next, you will look for genes that are on the same chromosome and strand as `COL1A2`.

3. **Identify the Preceding Gene**: Finally, you will sort these genes by their end position and find the one that ends just before the start of `COL1A2`.

### Python Code Example

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the above steps in Python:

```python
# Assuming you have a database connection `db` already established

# Step 1: Find the COL1A2 gene
col1a2 = next(filter(lambda x: x.attributes.get('gene_name', [''])[0] == 'COL1A2',
                     db.features_of_type('gene')))

# Get the chromosome and strand of COL1A2
chromosome = col1a2.seqid
strand = col1a2.strand

# Step 2: Find genes on the same strand and chromosome
same_strand_genes = [
    gene for gene in db.features_of_type('gene')
    if gene.seqid == chromosome and gene.strand == strand and gene.end < col1a2.start
]

# Step 3: Identify the gene that precedes COL1A2
if same_strand_genes:
    preceding_gene = max(same_strand_genes, key=lambda x: x.end)
    
    # Function to get gene info
    def get_gene_info(gene):
        gene_id = gene.attributes.get('gene_id', ['Unknown'])[0]
        gene_name = gene.attributes.get('gene_name', ['Unknown'])[0]
        return f"{gene_name} (ID: {gene_id})"
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"The gene that precedes COL1A2 is: {get_gene_info(preceding_gene)}")
else:
    print("No preceding gene found on the same strand as COL1A2.")
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Finding `COL1A2`**: The code uses a filter to find the gene with the name `COL1A2`.
- **Filtering Genes**: It then creates a list of genes that are on the same chromosome and strand as `COL1A2` and that end before `COL1A2` starts.
- **Finding the Preceding Gene**: The `max` function is used to find the gene with the maximum end position among those that precede `COL1A2`.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the name and ID of the preceding gene.

### Note
Make sure that your database connection (`db`) is properly established and that you have the necessary libraries (like `gffutils` if you're using it) installed in your Python environment.
