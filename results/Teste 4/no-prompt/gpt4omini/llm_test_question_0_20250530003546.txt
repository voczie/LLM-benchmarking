To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome Y using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow a similar approach to the code examples you provided. Below is a step-by-step guide along with the corresponding Python code.

### Step 1: Connect to the SQLite3 Database
First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite3 database. You can use the `sqlite3` module in Python to do this.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
db = db_connection.cursor()
```

### Step 2: Query for Genes on Chromosome Y
You will need to count the number of features of type 'gene' that are located on chromosome Y.

```python
# Count genes on chromosome Y
genes_y_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'Y'"
db.execute(genes_y_query)
genes_y_count = db.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome Y: {genes_y_count}")
```

### Step 3: Query for Transcripts on Chromosome Y
Next, you will count the number of features of type 'transcript' that are located on chromosome Y.

```python
# Count transcripts on chromosome Y
transcripts_y_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = 'Y'"
db.execute(transcripts_y_query)
transcripts_y_count = db.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome Y: {transcripts_y_count}")
```

### Step 4: Close the Database Connection
After you have executed your queries and obtained the counts, make sure to close the database connection.

```python
# Close the database connection
db_connection.close()
```

### Complete Code Example
Hereâ€™s the complete code that combines all the steps:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
db = db_connection.cursor()

# Count genes on chromosome Y
genes_y_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'Y'"
db.execute(genes_y_query)
genes_y_count = db.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome Y: {genes_y_count}")

# Count transcripts on chromosome Y
transcripts_y_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = 'Y'"
db.execute(transcripts_y_query)
transcripts_y_count = db.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome Y: {transcripts_y_count}")

# Close the database connection
db_connection.close()
```

### Summary
This code will provide you with the number of genes and transcripts located on chromosome Y by querying the `features` table in your SQLite3 database. Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.
