To find the BRCA1 transcript with the smallest average exon size, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve all transcripts associated with the BRCA1 gene**.
2. **For each transcript, retrieve its associated exons**.
3. **Calculate the average exon size for each transcript**.
4. **Determine which transcript has the smallest average exon size**.

Here's how you can implement this in Python using the SQLite3 database:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Get all transcript IDs for BRCA1
brca1_transcripts_query = """
SELECT f.id 
FROM features f 
WHERE f.featuretype = 'transcript' 
AND f.attributes LIKE '%gene_name BRCA1%'
"""
cursor.execute(brca1_transcripts_query)
brca1_transcripts = cursor.fetchall()

# Initialize a dictionary to hold average exon sizes
average_exon_sizes = {}

# Step 2: For each transcript, get its associated exons
for transcript in brca1_transcripts:
    transcript_id = transcript[0]
    
    # Get all exons for the current transcript
    exons_query = f"""
    SELECT f.start, f.end 
    FROM features f 
    JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child 
    WHERE r.parent = '{transcript_id}' 
    AND f.featuretype = 'exon'
    """
    cursor.execute(exons_query)
    exons = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Step 3: Calculate average exon size
    if exons:
        total_exon_size = sum(end - start + 1 for start, end in exons)
        num_exons = len(exons)
        average_exon_size = total_exon_size / num_exons
        average_exon_sizes[transcript_id] = average_exon_size

# Step 4: Find the transcript with the smallest average exon size
if average_exon_sizes:
    smallest_avg_exon_transcript = min(average_exon_sizes, key=average_exon_sizes.get)
    smallest_avg_exon_size = average_exon_sizes[smallest_avg_exon_transcript]
    
    print(f"The BRCA1 transcript with the smallest average exon size is {smallest_avg_exon_transcript} with an average size of {smallest_avg_exon_size:.2f} bp.")
else:
    print("No transcripts found for BRCA1.")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: Connect to the SQLite database where your GFF/GTF data is stored.
- **Query for Transcripts**: Retrieve all transcript IDs associated with the BRCA1 gene.
- **Retrieve Exons**: For each transcript, retrieve its associated exons using a JOIN on the `relations` table.
- **Calculate Average Exon Size**: For each transcript, calculate the total exon size and the average size.
- **Find Minimum**: Use the `min` function to find the transcript with the smallest average exon size.
- **Output**: Print the result.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
