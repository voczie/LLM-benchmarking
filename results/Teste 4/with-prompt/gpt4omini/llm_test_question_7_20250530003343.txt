To generate a scatterplot showing the relationship between gene length and the number of exons on chromosome X, we will follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve all genes on chromosome X** and calculate their lengths.
2. **Count the number of exons** associated with each gene.
3. **Plot the data** using a scatterplot.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that accomplishes this using the `gffutils` library and `matplotlib` for plotting:

```python
import gffutils
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Initialize lists to store gene lengths and exon counts
gene_lengths = []
exon_counts = []

# Iterate over all genes on chromosome X
for gene in db.features_of_type('gene'):
    if gene.seqid == 'X':
        # Calculate gene length
        gene_length = gene.end - gene.start + 1
        gene_lengths.append(gene_length)
        
        # Count the number of exons for this gene
        exons = list(db.children(gene.id, featuretype='exon'))
        exon_count = len(exons)
        exon_counts.append(exon_count)

# Generate the scatterplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(exon_counts, gene_lengths, alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Gene Length vs. Number of Exons on Chromosome X')
plt.xlabel('Number of Exons')
plt.ylabel('Gene Length (bp)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: We connect to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`.
- **Data Collection**:
  - We loop through each gene on chromosome X using `db.features_of_type('gene')`.
  - For each gene, we calculate its length using the formula `gene.end - gene.start + 1`.
  - We retrieve the exons associated with the gene using `db.children(gene.id, featuretype='exon')` and count them.
- **Plotting**: We use `matplotlib` to create a scatterplot, where the x-axis represents the number of exons and the y-axis represents the gene lengths.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file.
- Ensure that you have the necessary libraries (`gffutils`, `matplotlib`) installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip if needed:

```bash
pip install gffutils matplotlib
```

This script will provide a visual representation of the relationship between gene length and the number of exons for genes located on chromosome X.
