To answer the question of how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome Y, we can utilize the `gffutils` library to query the database. Below is a Python script that accomplishes this task. The script connects to the database, counts the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome Y, and prints the results.

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Count the number of genes on chromosome Y
genes_y = sum(1 for feature in db.features_of_type('gene') if feature.seqid == 'Y')
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome Y: {genes_y}")

# Count the number of transcripts on chromosome Y
transcripts_y = sum(1 for feature in db.features_of_type('transcript') if feature.seqid == 'Y')
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome Y: {transcripts_y}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Import the gffutils library**: This library is essential for interacting with GFF/GTF databases.
2. **Connect to the database**: Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file.
3. **Count genes**: We use a generator expression to iterate over all features of type 'gene' and check if their `seqid` (chromosome ID) is 'Y'. We sum up the counts to get the total number of genes.
4. **Count transcripts**: Similarly, we count the number of features of type 'transcript' on chromosome Y.
5. **Print results**: Finally, the script prints the counts of genes and transcripts.

Make sure to have the `gffutils` library installed and the database created from your GFF/GTF file before running this script.
