To determine how many protein-coding transcripts are present on chromosome 1 using the `gffutils` library, we can follow these steps:

1. Connect to the GFF/GTF database.
2. Fetch all transcript features on chromosome 1.
3. Filter these transcripts to count only those that are protein-coding.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Count protein-coding transcripts on chromosome 1
protein_coding_transcripts_chr1 = (
    feature for feature in db.features_of_type('transcript')
    if feature.seqid == '1' and feature.attributes.get('transcript_biotype', [''])[0] == 'protein_coding'
)

# Sum the number of protein-coding transcripts
count_protein_coding_transcripts = sum(1 for _ in protein_coding_transcripts_chr1)

# Print the result
print(f"Number of protein-coding transcripts on chromosome 1: {count_protein_coding_transcripts}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Importing the Library**: We start by importing the `gffutils` library.
- **Connecting to the Database**: We create a connection to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`. Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.
- **Fetching Transcripts**: We use a generator expression to iterate over all transcript features on chromosome 1. The condition checks if the `seqid` is '1' and if the `transcript_biotype` attribute indicates that the transcript is protein-coding.
- **Counting Transcripts**: We sum the number of valid transcripts using a generator expression.
- **Output**: Finally, we print the count of protein-coding transcripts found on chromosome 1.

Make sure to have the `gffutils` library installed and your database properly set up before running this script.
