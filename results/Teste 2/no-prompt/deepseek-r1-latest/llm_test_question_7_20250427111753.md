Okay, so I need to figure out how many exons the XIST gene has using the provided database schema and SQL. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that XIST is a non-coding RNA gene involved in X-chromosome inactivation. But wait, it's actually an RNA transcript, not coding for protein, so maybe it doesn't have exons like typical genes do? Hmm, but the user specifically asked about exons, so perhaps they're considering its genomic structure.

Looking at the database schema, there are tables: features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. The relevant one here is 'features' because that's where gene information should be stored.

In the features table, each row represents a feature in the genome, like genes, exons, etc. Each has an 'id', which I assume uniquely identifies it. So to find out how many exons XIST has, I need to look for entries in the features table where the feature type is 'exon' and the id is related to XIST.

Wait, but what's the correct way to get all exons that belong to a specific gene? Maybe there are relations between genes (parents) and their exons (children). So I should first find which exon corresponds to XIST, then count how many relations exist with it as the parent. Each relation would represent an exon.

So my plan is:

1. Find all features where featuretype is 'exon' and id matches XIST.
2. For each of these exons, check their parent relationships to see which one belongs to XIST.
3. Count how many such relations exist for the correct exon.

Alternatively, maybe there's a direct way by joining the features table with the relations table where the feature is 'exon' and the parent is XIST.

I think using a join between features and relations would be efficient here. So I can select from features where id is XIST, then join on the relation where child is that same ID, grouping by parent to count unique exons.

Wait, but each exon should have only one parent (the gene it belongs to), so counting distinct parents among exons of XIST would give me the number of exons. Alternatively, if I can find all relations where the parent is XIST and child is an exon, then group by child to get unique exons.

I think using a subquery might be better: select from features where id is in (select id from relations where parent = 'XIST'), but wait no, that's not quite right. Maybe I should first find all exons whose parents are XIST.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to get all exons and then count how many have their parent as XIST.

So maybe:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT child) FROM relations WHERE parent = 'XIST' AND featuretype = 'exon';

Wait, but in the schema, each relation has a parent, child, level. So if I can find all children (exons) where their parent is XIST and they are exons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first get all exons that belong to XIST by joining features with relations on id, then group by the exon's id and count unique ones.

But maybe a more straightforward way is:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) FROM relations r JOIN features f ON r.parent = f.id WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon' AND f.id = 'XIST';

Wait, but in the schema, each relation has parent and child. So if I join on f.id = r.parent, then for XIST as parent, the children would be its exons.

So yes, that should give me all exons of XIST.

But wait, what's the correct id for XIST? In GTF/GFF files, genes are usually annotated with their gene ID. So in the features table, 'id' is likely to be the gene ID. So I can query:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) FROM relations r JOIN features f ON r.parent = f.id WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon' AND f.id LIKE '%XIST%';

Wait, but maybe XIST's id is exactly 'XIST'. Or perhaps it's something else like 'chr1:XIST' or similar. So I need to make sure the query matches correctly.

Alternatively, if I don't know the exact ID, perhaps using a LIKE clause with 'XIST' in the name would work, but that might include other genes named XIST elsewhere.

But since we're looking for XIST specifically, it's better to use an exact match. So assuming the id is exactly 'XIST', the query would be:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) FROM relations r JOIN features f ON r.parent = f.id WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon' AND f.id = 'XIST';

This should give me the number of exons in XIST.

Alternatively, if I don't know the exact id and just want to get all exons under XIST, perhaps using a subquery:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT child) FROM relations WHERE parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND id LIKE '%XIST%');

But again, assuming the ID is exactly 'XIST', it's better to use that.

So putting it all together, I think the SQL query would be:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) AS exon_count FROM relations r JOIN features f ON r.parent = f.id WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon' AND f.id = 'XIST';

This should return the number of exons in XIST.

To determine how many exons are present in the XIST gene using the provided database schema, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The `features` table contains information about genomic features, including genes and their associated exons.

2. **Understand Feature Types**: In the `features` table, each row represents a feature with an `id`. Genes are typically annotated as 'gene', while exons are annotated as 'exon'.

3. **Find Exons for XIST**: We need to find all exons that belong to the XIST gene.

4. **Use Relations Table**: The `relations` table links features (like genes) with their constituent parts, such as exons. Each relation has a parent and child, where the parent is the feature (gene), and the child is an exon or other part of the genome.

5. **Query Strategy**:
   - Join the `features` table with the `relations` table on the `id`.
   - Filter for features annotated as 'exon' and whose `id` matches XIST.
   - Count the distinct children (exons) associated with XIST.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) AS exon_count FROM relations r JOIN features f ON r.parent = f.id WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon' AND f.id = 'XIST';
```

This query will return the number of exons in the XIST gene.
