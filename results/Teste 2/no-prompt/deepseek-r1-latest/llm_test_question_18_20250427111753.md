Okay, so I need to help generate a stacked bar plot that shows the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome. The data is stored in an SQLite database with a specific schema. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out which tables contain the necessary information. From the schema, there's a 'features' table that includes details about different genomic features like genes, lncRNAs, miRNAs, etc. Each feature has an 'id', 'seqid' (which would be the chromosome), and other attributes.

I think I need to extract data from the 'features' table where the feature type is either 'CDS' for protein-coding genes or 'lncRNA'/'miRNA' for the other types. So, a WHERE clause in the SQL query should filter these out.

Next, since we're dealing with proportions on each chromosome, I'll need to group the data by chromosome (seqid) and then calculate the proportion of each feature type within that chromosome. This might involve using aggregate functions like COUNT or SUM along with CASE WHEN statements to categorize each gene into its respective type.

Once I have the counts for each category per chromosome, I can visualize this in a stacked bar chart. The x-axis will represent the chromosomes (chr1, chr2, etc.), and the y-axis will show the proportion of each feature type. Each bar should be divided into three sections: protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA.

I also need to make sure that the data is normalized so that each chromosome's proportions sum up to 100%. This way, the stacked bars can effectively compare the relative sizes of each category across chromosomes.

Finally, I'll use a plotting library like matplotlib in Python or ggplot2 in R to create the visualization. The SQL query will provide the necessary data, which I can then import into my chosen visualization tool.

To generate a stacked bar plot showing the proportions of protein-coding (CDS), lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome separately, follow these steps:

1. **Extract Data from SQLite Database**:
   Use an SQL query to retrieve the necessary data from the 'features' table, filtering for CDS, lncRNA, and miRNA genes.

2. **Calculate Proportions by Chromosome**:
   Group the data by chromosome (seqid) and calculate the proportion of each feature type within each chromosome.

3. **Prepare Data for Visualization**:
   Ensure the proportions are normalized so that they sum to 100% per chromosome, allowing for effective comparison across chromosomes.

4. **Create Stacked Bar Plot**:
   Use a visualization library (e.g., matplotlib in Python or ggplot2 in R) to create a stacked bar chart with chromosomes on the x-axis and proportions on the y-axis.

Here's an example of how you might structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'CDS' THEN 1 END) AS protein_coding,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 END) AS lncRNA,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 END) AS miRNA
FROM 
    features
GROUP BY 
    chromosome;
```

This query will give you the counts for each feature type per chromosome, which you can then use to create your stacked bar plot.
