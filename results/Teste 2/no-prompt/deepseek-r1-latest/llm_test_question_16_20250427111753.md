<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to get specific information about certain genes using an SQLite database that's structured with GFF/GTF data. The user is asking for details on XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, NFKB1, COL1A2, HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12. They want chromosomal location, position, size, number of exons, average exon size, strand, and biotype.

First, I remember that GFF files store genomic features like genes, exons, etc., with specific attributes. In the database schema provided, there's a 'features' table that includes fields like id, seqid (chromosome), source (gene in this case), featuretype (exon for each gene isoform), start and end positions, strand, attributes which might include biotype, and other info.

So I think I need to query the 'features' table where the feature type is 'exon', but waitâ€”each gene can have multiple exons. But the user wants information per transcript isoform. Hmm, maybe each exon corresponds to a transcript? Or perhaps each gene has one or more transcripts, each with their own exons.

Wait, in GFF files, genes are often represented as single entries even if they have multiple transcripts. So I might need to join on 'seqid' and then group by the gene name along with other relevant fields like biotype.

So perhaps my query should select from the features table where featuretype is exon, group by id (which would be the gene's identifier), and include all necessary attributes. Then, for each gene, I can get its exons, which would allow me to calculate size, number of exons, average size, etc.

Wait, but how do I get the chromosome location? The 'seqid' field should give that, so I can extract it from there.

Let me outline what fields I need:

1. Chromosomal location: seqid
2. Position: start and end (maybe take the end - start + 1 as size)
3. Number of exons: count of exons per gene
4. Average exon size: average of (end - start + 1) for each exon
5. Strand: strand field
6. Biotype: from attributes, probably 'gene' or specific types like 'XIST'

So the plan is:

- Query the features table where featuretype is 'exon', group by id.
- For each group (each gene), extract:
  - seqid (chromosome)
  - start and end positions
  - strand
  - attributes to get biotype

But wait, how do I calculate size? The size of the chromosome location would be from the first exon's start to the last exon's end. So for each gene, find min(start) as chrom_start, max(end) as chrom_end, then size is (chrom_end - chrom_start + 1).

Number of exons: count of exons in the group.

Average exon size: sum all (end_i - start_i + 1) divided by number of exons.

So I need to write a SQL query that does this. It might involve subqueries or window functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using aggregate functions within the same query.

Wait, but grouping by id and then calculating these values per group would require some way to get min(start), max(end), count(exons), etc., for each gene.

So maybe:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
    COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
    (SUM(f.end - f.start + 1) / COUNT(f.id)) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    g.biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
GROUP BY g.id;

Wait, but the 'features' table doesn't have a 'biotype' field. Oh right, in GFF files, biotype is part of the attributes. So I need to extract that.

So perhaps using something like:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
    COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
    (SUM(f.end - f.start + 1) / COUNT(f.id)) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    g.biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But wait, the 'biotype' is in the attributes field. So I need to extract it from there.

So perhaps using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to parse the attributes into biotype.

Alternatively, maybe use something like:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start),
    MAX(f.end),
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1),
    COUNT(f.id),
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id),
    f.strand,
    g.biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But to get the biotype, I need to extract it from attributes. So perhaps:

g.biotype = (SELECT substring(g.attributes, index_of(' ') + 1) FROM genes g2 WHERE g2.id = g.id AND g2.attributes LIKE '%_biotype%');

Wait, that might not be efficient, but for the sake of this query, maybe.

Alternatively, using a subquery to extract biotype:

So perhaps:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start),
    MAX(f.end),
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1),
    COUNT(f.id),
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id),
    f.strand,
    (SELECT b.biotype FROM genes b WHERE b.id = g.id AND b.attributes LIKE '%_biotype%') AS biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But this might not be the most efficient way, but it's a starting point.

Wait, perhaps using a CTE to extract the biotype:

WITH gene_info AS (
    SELECT g.id, g.biotype,
           MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
           MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
           (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
           COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
           SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id) AS avg_exon_size,
           f.strand
    FROM features f
    JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
    WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
    GROUP BY g.id
)
SELECT * FROM gene_info;

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to extract biotype.

Wait, maybe it's better to use a join on attributes to get the biotype.

Alternatively, since each gene has multiple exons, and we're grouping by gene id, perhaps the biotype can be extracted from any of the exon's attributes that contain 'biotype'.

So in the features table, for an exon row, the attributes field might have something like 'gene_biotype' => 'XIST', etc.

So to extract biotype:

SELECT g.id,
       MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
       MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
       (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
       COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
       SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id) AS avg_exon_size,
       f.strand,
       g.biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But how to get g.biotype? Because in the join, we have f and g where f.seqid = g.id. So perhaps:

g.biotype = (SELECT b.biotype FROM genes b WHERE b.id = g.id);

Wait, but that would require another SELECT.

Alternatively, using a subquery inside the main query to extract biotype.

So maybe:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
    COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    (SELECT b.biotype FROM genes b WHERE b.id = g.id AND b.attributes LIKE '%_biotype%') AS biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But this might not be efficient, but it's a way to get the biotype.

Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery that selects the biotype for each gene:

So something like:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start),
    MAX(f.end),
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1),
    COUNT(f.id),
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id),
    f.strand,
    (SELECT biotype FROM genes WHERE id = g.id AND attributes LIKE '%_biotype%') AS biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But I'm not sure if this is the best way. Maybe it's better to extract the biotype from the first exon of each gene, assuming that all exons for a gene have the same biotype.

Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to get the biotype:

So maybe:

SELECT
    MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,
    COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    (SELECT b.biotype FROM genes b WHERE b.id = g.id AND b.attributes LIKE '%_biotype%') AS biotype
FROM features f
JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But again, this might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to extract the biotype for each gene:

    COUNT(f.id) AS num_exons,
    SUM(f.end - f.start + 1)/COUNT(f.id) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    biotype
FROM (
    SELECT g.id, b.biotype,
           MIN(f.start) AS chrom_start,
           MAX(f.end) AS chrom_end,
           (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start) + 1) AS size,

           f.strand
    FROM features f
    JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
    JOIN (SELECT b FROM genes WHERE b.id = g.id AND b.attributes LIKE '%_biotype%') biotype_info
    GROUP BY g.id
) AS subquery

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a LEFT JOIN with the genes table and then select the biotype from there.

So:

SELECT f.*,
       g.biotype
FROM features f
LEFT JOIN genes g ON f.seqid = g.id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY g.id;

But this might not give the correct results because we need to aggregate across all exons for each gene.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first get the aggregated features and then join with the genes table.

So:

WITH exon_features AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(start) AS chrom_start,
        MAX(end) AS chrom_end,
        (MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1) AS size,
        COUNT(id) AS num_exons,
        SUM(end - start + 1) AS total_length,
        strand
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT
    ef.chrom_start,
    ef.chrom_end,
    ef.size,
    ef.num_exons,
    ef.total_length / ef.num_exons AS avg_exon_size,
    ef.strand,
    g.biotype
FROM exon_features ef
JOIN genes g ON ef.id = g.id;

This seems more efficient and cleaner.

So the final query would be:

WITH exon_features AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(start) AS chrom_start,
        MAX(end) AS chrom_end,
        (MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1) AS size,
        COUNT(id) AS num_exons,
        SUM(end - start + 1) AS total_length,
        strand
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT
    chrom_start,
    chrom_end,
    size,
    num_exons,
    total_length / num_exons AS avg_exon_size,
    strand,
    biotype
FROM exon_features
JOIN genes ON exon_features.id = genes.id;

This should give the desired result.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to aggregate exon-level genomic features and associate them with their corresponding gene information. The goal is to compute various metrics such as the size of each exon, the number of exons per gene, the average length of exons for each gene, and the biotype of each gene.

### Approach
1. **Data Aggregation**: First, we aggregate the exon data to compute metrics like the minimum start position, maximum end position, total length, count of exons, and average exon size for each gene.
2. **Join with Gene Information**: After aggregating the exon data, we join this information with the gene details using the gene ID (ID) to associate each aggregated exon metric with its corresponding gene.
3. **Efficient Querying**: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), we encapsulate the aggregation step within a subquery for clarity and efficiency.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH exon_features AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(start) AS chrom_start,
        MAX(end) AS chrom_end,
        (MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1) AS size,
        COUNT(id) AS num_exons,
        SUM(end - start + 1) AS total_length,
        strand
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT
    chrom_start,
    chrom_end,
    size,
    num_exons,
    total_length / num_exons AS avg_exon_size,
    strand,
    biotype
FROM exon_features
JOIN genes ON exon_features.id = genes.id;
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Aggregation**: The CTE `exon_features` computes several metrics for each gene:
   - `chrom_start`: The minimum start position of all exons in the gene.
   - `chrom_end`: The maximum end position of all exons in the gene.
   - `size`: The total length of all exons combined, calculated as `(MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1)`.
   - `num_exons`: The count of exons in the gene.
   - `total_length`: The sum of lengths of all exons, computed as `SUM(end - start + 1)`.
   - `avg_exon_size`: The average length of exons for each gene, calculated as `total_length / num_exons`.

2. **Join with Gene Information**: After computing the aggregated exon features, we join this information with the `genes` table using the gene ID (`id`). This allows us to associate each computed metric with its corresponding gene's biotype.

This approach efficiently computes the required metrics and ensures that each gene has access to comprehensive genomic feature data.
