Okay, so I need to figure out how many miRNAs are present in chromosome 10 using the given database schema. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that miRNAs are a type of RNA, specifically micro RNAs, and they function in gene regulation. In the context of genome annotation, miRNAs would be represented as genes with the 'miRNA' feature type. So, I should look into the features table where the featuretype is 'miRNA'.

Next, each entry in the features table has a 'seqid', which refers to the chromosome it's located on. In this case, we're interested in chromosome 10, so I need to filter entries where seqid equals 'chr10'. 

Once I have all the miRNA entries on chromosome 10, each of these will have an 'id' that uniquely identifies them within their feature type group (miRNAs). To find out how many distinct miRNAs there are, I can use a SQL query that groups by id and counts the unique occurrences.

So putting this together, the SQL query should select the count of distinct ids from the features table where seqid is 'chr10' and featuretype is 'miRNA'. This will give me the total number of miRNAs on chromosome 10.

To determine how many miRNAs exist in chromosome 10 using the provided database schema, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look for entries in the `features` table where:
   - The feature type is 'miRNA' (indicating microRNAs).
   - The sequence ID (`seqid`) corresponds to chromosome 10 ('chr10').

2. **Count Unique miRNAs**: Use a SQL query to count distinct IDs of these features, as each unique ID represents a different miRNA.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_miRNAs
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'miRNA' AND seqid = 'chr10';
```

This query will return the number of distinct miRNAs found on chromosome 10.
