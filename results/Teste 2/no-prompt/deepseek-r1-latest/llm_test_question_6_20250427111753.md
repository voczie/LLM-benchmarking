Okay, so I need to figure out how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF data. The database schema includes tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. 

First, I should understand what each table represents. The 'features' table holds all the genomic annotations, including information about genes, transcripts, etc. Each feature has an id, which might be unique within its type. For transcripts, this id is probably their name.

I remember that in GFF files, a transcript can have multiple isoforms, and each isoform would be represented as separate entries with different attributes like 'id' or maybe the same id but different versions? Wait, no, I think each isoform might have its own unique id. So perhaps the 'id' field is sufficient to distinguish them.

But wait, in GFF/GTF format, a transcript can have multiple isoforms, and these are often represented with the same gene id but different transcript ids. Or maybe they're stored as separate entries under the same feature type. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe each isoform is a separate row in the 'features' table.

So to get all the transcript isoforms of XIST, I need to query the 'features' table where the feature type is 'transcript' and the gene id is 'XIST'. Then, for each such entry, extract the transcript name (probably from the 'id' field) and its length (from the 'end - start' calculation).

Wait, but in GFF files, sometimes the end might be exclusive or inclusive. I think it's usually exclusive, so the size would be end - start.

So my plan is:

1. Write a SQL query to select all transcripts where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST'.
2. For each result, get the transcript name (id) and calculate its length as end - start.
3. Count how many isoforms there are by checking the number of results.
4. Print the names and sizes.

But I'm not sure if all isoforms have unique ids or if some might share the same id but be different isoforms. Maybe in the database, each isoform is a separate row with its own attributes like 'transcript_id' as part of the 'id' field? Or perhaps it's stored under the same gene id but different transcript names.

Wait, looking at the schema, the 'features' table has an 'id' field. So for transcripts, each isoform would have a unique 'id', right? Because if they were not unique, there could be duplicates or relations between them.

So I can proceed with selecting all rows from 'features' where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST'. Then, group by the transcript name to see how many are present. Each group would represent an isoform.

Alternatively, maybe each isoform has a different 'id', so the count of such ids will give the number of isoforms.

So the SQL query might look like:

SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start) AS size FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id = 'XIST';

But wait, I'm not sure if all isoforms are stored as separate entries. Maybe some are in relations with others? Or perhaps they're part of a parent-child relationship where the parent is the gene and the child is the transcript.

Wait, looking at the schema, there's a 'relations' table with parent and child fields. So maybe each isoform has multiple relations if it's an alternative splicing variant or something like that.

Hmm, but for this question, I just need to count how many transcripts (isoforms) XIST has. So perhaps the 'features' table contains all the isoforms as separate entries with their own ids.

Alternatively, maybe each isoform is represented by a single row in the 'features' table, so selecting where id='XIST' and featuretype='transcript' would give me all the isoforms.

Wait, but if XIST has multiple isoforms, they might have different start and end positions or different attributes. So I need to make sure that each entry is a separate isoform.

So perhaps the query should be:

SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start) AS size FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id LIKE '%XIST%' OR id = 'XIST';

Wait, but in GTF files, sometimes the gene id might have attributes attached. So maybe it's better to use a LIKE query with %XIST% as part of the id.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if XIST is present and then count all its transcripts.

But for now, let's proceed with selecting all isoforms where featuretype is 'transcript' and id starts with or equals 'XIST'.

Once I have that list, each row represents an isoform. So the number of rows will be the count.

Then, to get the transcript names and their sizes, I can extract them from the query results.

So in summary, my steps are:

1. Query the 'features' table for all transcripts (featuretype='transcript') with id='XIST'.
2. For each result, note the transcript name (id) and calculate size as end - start.
3. Count the number of such entries to determine how many isoforms there are.
4. Output the names and sizes.

I think that's a solid approach. Now I'll write out the SQL query accordingly.

To determine the number of transcript isoforms for the XIST gene and their respective sizes, follow these steps:

1. **Query the Database**: Use an SQL query to retrieve all transcripts (featuretype='transcript') with the id 'XIST' from the 'features' table.

2. **Extract Information**: For each retrieved record, extract the transcript name (id) and calculate its size as `end - start`.

3. **Count Isoforms**: The number of records returned will indicate how many isoforms exist for XIST.

4. **Output Results**: List each transcript name along with its size.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start) AS size FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id LIKE '%XIST%';
```

This query will return all isoforms of XIST, each on a separate line with their name and size.
