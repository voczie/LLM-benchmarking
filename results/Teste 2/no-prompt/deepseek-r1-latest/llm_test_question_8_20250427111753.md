Okay, so I need to figure out how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has. The user wants me to print the transcript isoform names along with the number of exons. 

First, I remember that in GFF format, there's a specific structure for transcripts and their features like exons. Each exon is represented as an 'exon' feature type within a transcript. So, my plan is to query the database using the features table where the featuretype is 'exon'. But wait, each transcript can have multiple exons, so I need to group them by the gene name.

BRCA1 is the gene in question, but I should make sure that I'm looking at its isoforms. Isoforms are usually distinguished by different IDs or annotations within the same gene. So, perhaps the 'id' field will help here. 

I think the steps would be:
1. Retrieve all exons from the features table where featuretype is 'exon'.
2. For each exon, get the corresponding transcript (child) and its name.
3. Count how many exons are associated with each transcript.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact SQL syntax for this. Maybe using a join between features and relations could help since transcripts might be related to their parent genes or something like that. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to directly query the exons and group them by the transcript name.

I should also consider that each exon is part of a single transcript, so grouping by 'id' (assuming that the transcript id is unique per isoform) would give me all the exons for each isoform. Then, I can count the number of exons in each group.

So, putting it together, I'll write a SQL query that selects the 'id' as the transcript name and counts the number of exons (counting each exon once per transcript). That should give me the desired output.

To determine how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, we can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves the transcript isoforms along with their exon count:

```sql
SELECT 
    id AS transcript_name,
    COUNT(exon.id) AS num_exons
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon'
    AND id LIKE '%BRCA1%'
GROUP BY 
    id;
```

**Explanation:**
- `id AS transcript_name`: This renames the `id` column to `transcript_name` for clarity.
- `COUNT(exon.id) AS num_exons`: Counts the number of exons associated with each transcript.
- `WHERE id LIKE '%BRCA1%'`: Filters results to only include BRCA1 transcripts.
- `GROUP BY id`: Groups the results by the transcript ID, ensuring we get one count per isoform.

**Output:**
This query will return a table where each row represents a transcript isoform of BRCA1 and its corresponding exon count.
