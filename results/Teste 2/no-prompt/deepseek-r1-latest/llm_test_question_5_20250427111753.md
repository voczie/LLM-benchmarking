Okay, so I need to calculate the sizes of each gene locus for specific genes using a SQLite database that contains genome annotation data. The schema provided includes tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. 

First, I should figure out which table holds the information about the size of each gene's locus. Since the user is asking about the sizes of loci for certain genes, it makes sense that this information would be stored in a separate table, perhaps called 'sizes' or something similar.

Looking at the schema, there isn't an explicit 'sizes' table mentioned. So maybe I need to create one by extracting the necessary data from the existing tables. The features table seems to contain all the genomic annotations, including start and end positions which can be used to calculate the size of each locus.

I'll need to write a SQL query that joins the features table with other relevant tables (like relations) if needed, but perhaps it's not necessary here since I'm only interested in the sizes. Then, group by gene name and sum up the lengths where the feature type is 'gene'. 

Wait, maybe each locus has multiple genes? Or are these individual genes within a locus? The user specified single genes, so probably each row represents a single gene's locus.

So, I'll write a SELECT statement that selects from the features table, groups by id (assuming id is the gene name), and calculates the difference between end and start plus one to get the size. Then, I'll order the results in descending order of size for clarity.

I should also consider if there are any duplicates or relations affecting this calculation, but since the user didn't mention them, maybe it's safe to proceed without joining those tables unless necessary.

Finally, I'll test the query with sample data to ensure it works correctly. If the sizes table doesn't exist yet, perhaps I need to create it by running a script that extracts the necessary information from features and saves it into 'sizes'. But since the user is asking for a query, maybe they just want the SQL statement without creating new tables.

So, putting it all together, the SQL query will select the gene name (id), calculate the size as end - start + 1, group by id, order them, and then save this result into a 'sizes' table. Then, I can retrieve that data to answer the user's question.

To calculate the sizes of each gene locus for the specified genes, you'll need to use SQL queries on your SQLite database. Here's how you can approach it:

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Data
The `features` table contains genomic annotations, including start and end positions which are essential for calculating the size.

### Step 2: Write the SQL Query
Use a SELECT statement to calculate the size of each locus by subtracting the start position from the end position. Group the results by gene name (id) and order them in descending order of size.

```sql
SELECT id AS gene_name, 
       (end - start + 1) AS size,
       COUNT(*) AS count_of_transcripts
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
GROUP BY id;
```

### Step 3: Save Results to a New Table
Save the results of this query into a new table called `sizes`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sizes (
    gene_name TEXT,
    size INTEGER,
    count_of_transcripts INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sizes (gene_name, size, count_of_transcripts)
SELECT gene_name, size, COUNT(*) 
FROM (
    SELECT id AS gene_name, 
           (end - start + 1) AS size,
           COUNT(*) AS count_of_transcripts
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
    GROUP BY id
) AS result;
```

### Step 4: Retrieve the Results
Now you can retrieve the sizes from the `sizes` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sizes ORDER BY size DESC;
```

This will give you a list of genes with their respective locus sizes, ordered by size.
