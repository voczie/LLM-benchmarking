Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the provided database schema. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that BRCA1 can have multiple isoforms, each with different exons. So my goal is to find all the exons for each isoform and then compute their lengths.

Looking at the database tables, there's a 'features' table where each feature is stored. Exons are probably stored here as 'exon' type features. The schema includes fields like id, seqid, source, featuretype, start, end, strand, etc. So I can use these to get the necessary information.

I think I'll need two main pieces of information for each exon: the start and end positions. The length would then be end - start + 1 (since both ends are inclusive). But wait, in GTF files, sometimes the end is exclusive, so maybe it's just end - start. Hmm, but looking at the schema, 'start' and 'end' are integers without any specific note on inclusivity. I'll proceed with calculating length as end - start + 1 to include both ends.

Next, I need to identify all isoforms of BRCA1. The featuretype for exons is probably stored in a column named something like 'featuretype'. So the query should select distinct featuretype where id starts with 'BRCA1' and type is exon.

Once I have each exon's start and end positions, I can calculate their lengths. Then, group these by isoform to find the average length per isoform.

Putting this together, I'll write a SQL query that selects exons for BRCA1 isoforms, calculates their lengths, groups them by isoform, and then computes the average.

Wait, but how do I handle multiple isoforms? Each isoform will have its own set of exons. So grouping by 'id' where id starts with 'BRCA1' makes sense because each exon's id should include the gene name and isoform identifier.

I think using a subquery to get all BRCA1 exons first, then calculating their lengths in another CTE or directly in the main query would work. Alternatively, I can calculate the length inline by subtracting start from end and adding 1.

So the final query should select the average of (end - start + 1) for each isoform group.

To determine the average exon size of BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the provided database schema, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Exons for BRCA1 Isoforms**:
   Use a subquery to retrieve all exons where `id` starts with 'BRCA1'.

2. **Calculate Exon Lengths**:
   For each exon, compute its length as `end - start + 1`.

3. **Group by Isoform**:
   Group the results by the isoform identifier (e.g., BRCA1.X).

4. **Compute Average Length**:
   Calculate the average length for each group.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    id AS isoform,
    AVG(end - start + 1) AS avg_exon_length
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    id LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

This query retrieves all exons for BRCA1 isoforms, calculates their lengths, and computes the average exon size per isoform.
