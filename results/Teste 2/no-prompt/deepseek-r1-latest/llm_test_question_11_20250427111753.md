Okay, so I need to figure out where on the chromosomes the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB are located. The user mentioned that the data is stored in a SQLite database with a specific schema. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that GFF/GTF files store genomic annotations. Each gene will have attributes like their name, location on the chromosome (start and end positions), strand, etc. So, to find where these genes are located, I need to query the database for each gene's start and end positions along with the chromosome.

Looking at the schema provided, there's a table called 'features' which should contain all the genomic features, including genes. Each feature has an 'id', 'seqid' (which is the chromosome), 'start', and 'end'. So I can write a SQL query that selects these fields for each gene.

I'll need to run this query five times, once for each gene: NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in one query with a WHERE clause that includes all the gene IDs. That might be more efficient.

Wait, but I should check if these genes are present in the database. If any of them aren't found, the query will return nothing for those. So I need to make sure they exist before proceeding.

Once I have the results, each entry will show the chromosome (seqid), start position, and end position. The user wants to know on which chromosomes these genes are located, so if all five genes are in the same chromosome, that's the answer. If not, I'll list them separately.

I should also consider whether the 'start' and 'end' positions define a single gene or multiple genes. But since each query will return one row per gene, it should be fine.

So, putting it all together, I can write a SQL script that selects the necessary columns for each gene and then analyze the results to determine their chromosome locations.

To determine the chromosomes on which the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB are located, follow these steps:

1. **Query the Database**: Use a SQL query to retrieve the genomic location (start and end positions) of each gene along with their chromosome.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       features.id AS gene_id,
       features.seqid AS chromosome,
       features.start AS start_position,
       features.end AS end_position
   FROM 
       features
   WHERE 
       features.id IN ('NFkB1', 'NFkB2', 'RE', 'RELA', 'RELB');
   ```

2. **Analyze the Results**: The query will return a table with columns for gene ID, chromosome, start position, and end position.

3. **Determine Chromosome Locations**:
   - If all genes are in the same chromosome, that is your answer.
   - If they span multiple chromosomes, list each gene's respective chromosome.

For example, if the query results show:

| gene_id | chromosome | start_position | end_position |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| NFKB1   | chrX       | 5000          | 10000       |
| NFKB2   | chrX       | 15000         | 20000       |
| RE      | chrY       | 30000         | 40000       |
| RELA    | chrY       | 45000         | 60000       |
| RELB    | chrZ       | 75000         | 90000       |

This indicates that:
- NFKB1 and NFKB2 are on chromosome chrX.
- REL is on chromosome chrY, with RELA and RELB on chromosome chrZ.

Thus, the genes are located across different chromosomes.
