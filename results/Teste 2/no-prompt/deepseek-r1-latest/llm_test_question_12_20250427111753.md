Okay, so I need to figure out how to print the names of the two genes right before and after COL1A2 using a SQLite database. The database has tables for features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates.

First, I know that COL1A2 is a gene, so it's probably stored in the 'features' table with its featuretype as 'gene'. Each gene will have an id like 'ID=COL1A2'. 

I remember that to find genes before and after, I can use the 'relations' table. This table links features through parent-child relationships based on their genomic positions. So, COL1A2's parent would be its upstream gene (the one immediately before it), and its child would be the downstream gene.

So, my plan is:

1. Find the parent of COL1A2 to get the gene before it.
2. Find the child of COL1A2 to get the gene after it.

I'll write two SQL queries for this. Each query will select the 'id' from the 'features' table where either the parent or child is COL1A2, and then extract the id from that row.

Wait, but how do I make sure these are genes? Maybe I should limit the results to just one each since there's only two genes immediately before and after. So, using LIMIT 1 would help.

Putting it all together, I'll write a query that selects the parent first, then another for the child.

To find the names of the two genes located immediately before and after COL1A2 in your SQLite database, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify the Parent Gene (Before COL1A2):**
   - Use a SQL query to select the parent feature where the child is 'COL1A2'.
   
2. **Identify the Child Gene (After COL1A2):**
   - Use another SQL query to select the child feature where the parent is 'COL1A2'.

### SQL Queries:

```sql
-- Query to find the gene immediately before COL1A2
SELECT id AS upstream_gene FROM features WHERE parent = 'COL1A2' LIMIT 1;

-- Query to find the gene immediately after COL1A2
SELECT id AS downstream_gene FROM features WHERE child = 'COL1A2' LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **`upstream_gene`:** This query retrieves the ID of the gene that is immediately before COL1A2 in the genomic sequence.
- **`downstream_gene`:** This query retrieves the ID of the gene that is immediately after COL1A2.

By executing these two queries, you will obtain the IDs of the genes located right before and right after COL1A2.
