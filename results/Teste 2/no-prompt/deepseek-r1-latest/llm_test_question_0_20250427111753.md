Okay, so I need to figure out how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using the provided database schema. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that in GFF/GTF format, each feature is represented with specific attributes. For genes, the main attribute would be 'gene_id', which uniquely identifies a gene. Similarly, for transcripts, the primary identifier is usually 'transcript_id'. 

Looking at the database schema, there's a table called 'features' which has an 'id' column. I assume that this 'id' field corresponds to either 'gene_id' or 'transcript_id' from the GTF/GFF files. So, if I can extract all entries in the 'features' table where the type is 'gene' and another set where the type is 'transcript', then I can count their respective IDs.

But wait, how do I ensure that each feature is correctly categorized as a gene or transcript? The schema doesn't explicitly state what each 'featuretype' corresponds to. However, based on standard GTF/GFF usage, 'gene' would be for genes and 'transcript' for transcripts. So, I can proceed with this assumption.

Next, the database has separate tables like 'relations', 'meta', etc., but since my query only needs counts of genes and transcripts, these other tables might not be necessary unless there's a relationship that affects their count. But in this case, it seems they're just for other purposes, so I can ignore them.

So, the plan is to write two separate SQL queries: one counting unique 'id's where the featuretype is 'gene', and another doing the same for 'transcript'. 

I'll use a SELECT statement with DISTINCT on the id field. The COUNT function will give me the number of unique IDs, which corresponds to the number of genes or transcripts.

Putting it all together, I can write two queries:

1. For genes: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene';
2. For transcripts: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript';

This should give me the counts for each on chromosome 3 if I ensure that only entries related to chromosome 3 are considered, but waitâ€”the schema doesn't have a column indicating the chromosome number. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps in the GTF/GFF files, features also have a 'seqid' field which indicates the chromosome they belong to. So, if I include 'WHERE seqid = 'chr3'' in my queries, that would filter only entries on chromosome 3.

So, updating the queries:

1. For genes: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'chr3';
2. For transcripts: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = 'chr3';

This way, I'm specifically looking for features on chromosome 3 and counting their unique IDs.

I should also consider case sensitivity in the 'seqid'. GTF/GFF files often use lowercase for chromosomes, so if my database has them in a different case, that might cause issues. But since it's SQLite, which is case-sensitive by default, I need to make sure that the string matches exactly. So, using 'chr3' as the exact match.

Alternatively, maybe the schema includes an 'id' field for each feature type, but without knowing more about how the data is structured beyond the schema, this seems like a reasonable approach.

So, in summary, I'll write two SQL queries that count distinct IDs where featuretype is either 'gene' or 'transcript' and seqid is 'chr3'. This should give me the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.

To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3, we can use the provided database schema to write SQL queries that count the distinct IDs for each feature type specifically on chromosome 3.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The 'features' table contains all genomic features, including genes and transcripts. We need this table to filter by feature type and chromosome.

2. **Filter by Chromosome**: Since we're interested in chromosome 3, we'll include a condition to filter entries where `seqid` is 'chr3'.

3. **Count Unique IDs**:
   - For genes: Use the 'gene_id' field.
   - For transcripts: Use the 'transcript_id' field.

4. **Use DISTINCT and COUNT**: To count unique IDs, we'll use `COUNT(DISTINCT id)` in our SELECT statements.

### SQL Queries:

```sql
-- Count of Genes on chromosome 3
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS gene_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'chr3';

-- Count of Transcripts on chromosome 3
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS transcript_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = 'chr3';
```

### Explanation:

- **Query Execution**: These queries will execute against the 'features' table, filtering for rows where `featuretype` is either 'gene' or 'transcript' and `seqid` is 'chr3'. The COUNT function with DISTINCT ensures we count each unique ID only once.

- **Result Interpretation**:
  - The first query returns the total number of distinct genes on chromosome 3.
  - The second query returns the total number of distinct transcripts on chromosome 3.

By running these two queries, you will obtain the counts needed to answer how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3.
