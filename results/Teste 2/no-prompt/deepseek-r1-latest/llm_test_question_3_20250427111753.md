Okay, so I need to figure out how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome using the provided database schema. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that pseudogenes are a type of non-coding RNA transcript derived from gene pseudovariants. They don't code for proteins but can have some similarity to their corresponding genes. So, in the GFF/GTF format, pseudogenes would be listed under a featuretype like 'gene_pseudogene'.

Next, I need to connect this information to the database schema provided. The main tables are features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. Since we're dealing with gene data, the 'features' table is probably where I should start.

Looking at the 'features' table schema, it has columns like id, seqid, source, featuretype, start, end, score, strand, frame, attributes, extra, bin, and primary key (id). The featuretype column seems to be where pseudogenes would be stored. So I can query this table for rows where featuretype is 'gene_pseudogene'.

But wait, the question specifically asks about pseudogenes on the X chromosome. That means I need an additional condition in my query: the seqid should correspond to sequences that are on chromosome X.

I'm not entirely sure how the seqid works here. Maybe each seqid refers to a specific chromosome or region. So perhaps there's another table, like relations, which links features together with their chromosomes? Or maybe the 'seqid' itself contains information about the chromosome?

Wait, looking back at the schema, I don't see any other tables that directly link features to chromosomes. Hmm, this might be a problem because without knowing how seqid relates to chromosomes, it's hard to filter for X chromosome pseudogenes.

Alternatively, maybe each feature has an associated chromosome in its 'seqid' or another column. But since the schema doesn't specify, I can only work with what's given. Perhaps the 'features' table includes a 'chromosome' field that isn't listed here? Or maybe it's part of the 'attributes' field.

Wait, looking at the attributes column in the features table: "text" type. So perhaps the attributes contain information like chromosome or other relevant details. For example, an attribute might be something like "chromosome=X chromosome".

So I can modify my query to look for features where featuretype is 'gene_pseudogene' and their attributes include a chromosome field that's X.

Putting this together, my SQL query would select the count of such features from the features table. But since I don't have access to the actual data or how the attributes are structured beyond being in a text column, I can only write a query based on these assumptions.

So, the final query would be something like:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene'
AND (attributes LIKE '%chromosome=X chromosome%');

This counts all pseudogenes where the attributes mention X chromosome. However, without knowing exactly how the data is stored in the attributes field, this might not give accurate results.

Alternatively, if there's a separate table that links features to chromosomes, I could join on that, but since it's not provided here, I have to work with what's available.

In summary, my approach would be:

1. Identify pseudogenes in the 'features' table.
2. Filter those pseudogenes based on their chromosome being X.
3. Count the number of such entries.

But without more information about how chromosomes are stored, this is as far as I can go with the given schema.

To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using the provided database schema, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Pseudogenes**: Use a query to select features where `featuretype` is 'gene_pseudogene'.

2. **Filter by Chromosome X**: Since the schema doesn't explicitly link chromosomes to features through seqid or another table, assume that chromosome information might be stored in the attributes field of the 'features' table.

3. **Query Construction**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene'
   AND (attributes LIKE '%chromosome=X chromosome%');
   ```

4. **Considerations**: This query assumes that attributes containing 'X chromosome' will correctly identify pseudogenes on the X chromosome. Without explicit linking tables, this approach is based on attribute parsing.

5. **Result Interpretation**: The result of this query will give the count of pseudogenes found on the X chromosome based on the data's structure in the attributes field.

This method leverages the available schema to make an educated guess about how chromosome information is stored and applies it to filter pseudogenes specifically for the X chromosome.
