Okay, so I need to figure out which genes are located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both the positive and negative strands using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand the structure of the database schema provided. There's a features table with various fields like id, seqid, source, featuretype, etc., which includes information about genes. Then there are relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates tables, but for now, I think focusing on the features table is enough.

The user wants to find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands. So, I need to identify where these genes are located in the database. Each gene will have a start and end position, along with strand information (positive or negative).

I'll start by querying the features table for all records where featuretype is 'gene'. Then, I'll filter those based on whether their id starts with HOXC11 or HOXC12 to get the specific genes. From there, I can extract their start and end positions as well as strand information.

Once I have that data, I can sort the genes by their start position in ascending order for each strand. This will help me determine which gene comes after HOXC11 and before HOXC12 on both strands.

After identifying the relevant range of genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12, I'll need to extract all the gene IDs within that range for both positive and negative strands.

I should also consider potential issues like overlapping genes or duplicated entries. The database has a duplicates table which might help in case there are alternative IDs, but since we're focusing on specific genes, maybe it's not necessary here unless there are duplicate entries with different IDs.

Finally, I'll present the results clearly, listing each gene ID along with their start and end positions for both strands.

To determine which genes are located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both the positive (forward) and negative (reverse) strands using a SQLite database containing GFF/GTF data, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Genes of Interest
First, locate the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 in your database. This can be done by querying the `features` table for genes with IDs starting with "HOXC11" or "HOXC12".

```sql
SELECT * FROM features WHERE id LIKE 'HOXC11%' OR id LIKE 'HOXC12%';
```

### Step 2: Extract Relevant Gene Information
Next, extract the start and end positions along with strand information for all genes. This will help determine their order on each strand.

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    start as gene_start,
    end as gene_end,
    strand
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Step 3: Filter Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12
Sort the genes by their start position on each strand to determine which genes lie between HOXC11 and HOXC12.

#### For Positive (Forward) Strand:
```sql
WITH gene_list AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        gene_start,
        gene_end,
        strand
    FROM 
        features
    WHERE 
        featuretype = 'gene'
)
SELECT 
    g1.id as gene_id,
    g1.gene_start,
    g1.gene_end,
    g1.strand AS strand
FROM 
    gene_list g1
JOIN 
    gene_list g2 ON 
        (g1.id != g2.id) AND 
        (g1.gene_start > g2.gene_start OR g1.gene_end < g2.gene_end)
WHERE 
    (g1.id LIKE 'HOXC11%' OR g1.id LIKE 'HOXC12%') AND
    (g2.id LIKE 'HOXC11%' OR g2.id LIKE 'HOXC12%')
    AND g1.strand = 'positive' AND g2.strand = 'positive';
```

#### For Negative (Reverse) Strand:
```sql
WITH gene_list AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        gene_start,
        gene_end,
        strand
    FROM 
        features
    WHERE 
        featuretype = 'gene'
)
SELECT 
    g1.id as gene_id,
    g1.gene_start,
    g1.gene_end,
    g1.strand AS strand
FROM 
    gene_list g1
JOIN 
    gene_list g2 ON 
        (g1.id != g2.id) AND 
        (g1.gene_start > g2.gene_start OR g1.gene_end < g2.gene_end)
WHERE 
    (g1.id LIKE 'HOXC11%' OR g1.id LIKE 'HOXC12%') AND
    (g2.id LIKE 'HOXC11%' OR g2.id LIKE 'HOXC12%')
    AND g1.strand = 'negative' AND g2.strand = 'negative';
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Results
The queries will return gene IDs along with their start and end positions for both strands. Genes that fall between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on each strand will be listed.

### Final Answer:
Here are the genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands:

#### Positive Strand:
- Gene ID: [Gene1_ID], Start: [Gene1_Start], End: [Gene1_End]
- Gene ID: [Gene2_ID], Start: [Gene2_Start], End: [Gene2_End]

#### Negative Strand:
- Gene ID: [Gene3_ID], Start: [Gene3_Start], End: [Gene3_End]
- Gene ID: [Gene4_ID], Start: [Gene4_Start], End: [Gene4_END]

(Note: Replace placeholders with actual gene IDs and positions obtained from the database queries.)
