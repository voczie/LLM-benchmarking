<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many protein-coding genes are on chromosome 12 using the provided database schema. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that in GFF/GTF format, each feature is described with specific attributes. Protein-coding genes would be annotated as "gene" type and have a "CDS" (coding sequence) start and end positions. So, my goal is to count all such features where the seqid is 'chr12' or just 12 if that's how it's stored.

Looking at the database schema, I see there are tables for features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. The main table here is "features". Each row in this table represents a genomic feature like genes, exons, etc., with their attributes.

I need to write an SQL query that selects from the features table where:
1. The seqid matches 'chr12' or 12.
2. The feature type is 'gene'.
3. The attribute value for CDS exists and has both start and end positions.

Wait, but in SQLite, how do I check if a field exists? Oh right, using the LIKE operator with '%attribute%' can help identify fields that contain specific attributes. So, something like WHERE attributes LIKE '%CDS%'.

Also, since we're only interested in protein-coding genes, their CDS should have start and end positions. So, perhaps I need to ensure that both 'start' and 'end' are present for the CDS attribute.

Putting it all together, my query would select from features where seqid is 12 (assuming that's how chromosome IDs are stored as integers), featuretype is gene, and attributes contain CDS with start and end positions.

Wait, but in the schema, the 'start' and 'end' fields are present. So maybe I can directly check if those values exist for the CDS attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a subquery or a join, but since each gene has only one CDS (I think), using a WHERE clause with the attributes LIKE '%CDS%' should suffice.

So, my initial query would be:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%CDS%';

But wait, I need to ensure that CDS has start and end. So maybe the attributes field for a gene with CDS should have something like 'CDS;start=...;end=...' or similar.

So perhaps using a subquery to check if both start and end are present in the CDS attribute would be better, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, I can assume that any presence of CDS implies it has those fields. So maybe my initial query is sufficient.

But wait, what if some genes have other attributes? For example, a gene could have an intron or exon with start and end points as well. But for our case, we're only interested in the CDS part.

So perhaps I can extract the CDS attribute from the features table and check its contents.

Wait, maybe using a subquery to get the CDS attribute's value:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (SELECT substr(attributes, 14) FROM features WHERE id = f.id LIKE '%CDS%') LIKE '%start=interval%end=interval';

Hmm, that might work. But it's a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to check if the CDS attribute contains both start and end:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (SELECT substr(attributes, 14) FROM features WHERE id = f.id LIKE '%CDS%') LIKE '%start=interval%end=interval';

Wait, maybe I can simplify this by using a subquery that checks if the CDS attribute contains both start and end.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a WHERE clause with the attributes field containing 'CDS;start=...;end=...' or similar. But in reality, the exact format depends on how the data is stored.

Wait, maybe I can split the attributes string into parts using semicolons and check for CDS, then start, end.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to just count all features where seqid=chr12, featuretype=gene, and attributes contain 'CDS'.

So my initial query would be:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%CDS%';

But I'm not sure if that's accurate because other features might have CDS in their attributes. For example, an exon or intron could also have a CDS-like attribute? Or maybe only genes have CDS.

Wait, no, exons and introns don't have CDS; they are within genes. So perhaps the presence of 'CDS' in the attributes is specific to gene features.

So my initial query should work: count all features where seqid=chr12, featuretype=gene, and attributes include 'CDS'.

But wait, what if a gene has multiple CDS? I think that's unlikely. So this should give me the correct count.

Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to extract the CDS attribute for each gene and then check its start and end:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (SELECT substr(attributes, 14) FROM features WHERE id = f.id LIKE '%CDS%') LIKE '%start=interval%end=interval';

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe the initial query is sufficient.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a subquery to get all CDS attributes and then check their start and end:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (SELECT substr(attributes, 14) FROM features WHERE id = f.id LIKE '%CDS%') LIKE '%start=interval%end=interval';

AND (SELECT substr(attributes, 14) FROM features WHERE id = f.id LIKE '%CDS%') LIKE '%start=interval%end=interval';

But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to get all CDS attributes and then check their start and end.

Wait, maybe it's better to use a subquery that gets the CDS attribute for each gene and checks its contents:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene'
