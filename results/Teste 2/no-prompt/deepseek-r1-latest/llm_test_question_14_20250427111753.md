Okay, so I need to figure out the strand of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in GFF files, each feature is described with attributes like 'start', 'end', 'score', 'strand', etc. The 'strand' attribute tells us whether the genomic region is on the plus strand or minus strand (which would be the opposite strand).

I think the database has a table called features which stores all these details for each gene. So, I need to write a SQL query that selects the 'strand' from this table where the feature type is one of HOTAIR, HOXC11, or HOXC12.

Wait, but how do I get those exact gene names? In GFF files, genes are usually annotated with their IDs. So, each of these genes (HOTAIR, HOXC11, HOXC12) will have an 'id' field in the features table. The 'strand' for each should be either '+' or '-'.

So my query needs to select from the features table where featuretype is HOTAIR OR HOXC11 OR HOXC12 and then get the strand column.

I think I can structure it like this: SELECT strand FROM features WHERE id LIKE 'HOTAIR' OR id LIKE 'HOXC11' OR id LIKE 'HOXC12'. But wait, maybe using the featuretype is more accurate. So perhaps WHERE featuretype IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12').

Yes, that makes sense because each of these genes will have their specific featuretype. So I can write a query like:

SELECT strand FROM features WHERE featuretype IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12');

This should return the strand for each gene. If it's '+', they're on the forward strand; if '-', on the reverse.

I also need to make sure that the database has these entries and that the query runs correctly, but assuming the data is correct, this should work.

To determine the strands of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes in your SQLite database, you can use a SQL query. Here's how:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Table:** The features table contains all genomic annotations, including strand information.

2. **Select Strand Information:** Use the `strand` column to get the strand for each gene.

3. **Filter by Gene Names:** Use a `WHERE` clause with `IN` to filter rows where `featuretype` is one of the genes in question.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT strand FROM features WHERE featuretype IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12');
```

**Expected Output:**
- Each gene will return its respective strand, either '+' for forward or '-' for reverse.
