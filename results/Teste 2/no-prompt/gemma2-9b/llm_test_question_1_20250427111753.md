Here's how you can find the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using your SQLite3 database schema:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that match the criteria in our `WHERE` clause.
2. **`FROM features`**: We are querying the `features` table, which stores gene annotation data.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'chr12'`**:  This filters for genes located on chromosome 12. Remember to adjust this if your database uses a different naming convention for chromosomes.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**: This further narrows down the results to only include entries classified as genes.
5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%'`**:  This is crucial! It searches for genes with the attribute "protein_coding" within their `attributes` field. The `LIKE` operator with the wildcard '%' allows us to find variations in how this attribute might be represented (e.g., "protein_coding", "PROTEIN_CODING", etc.).

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Representation:**  The exact way "protein_coding" is stored in the `attributes` field can vary. You might need to adjust the `LIKE` clause based on your specific database schema.
* **Chromosome Naming:** Ensure that 'chr12' matches the actual name used in your database for chromosome 12.
