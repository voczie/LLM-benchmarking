Here's how you can find the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 using your SQLite3 database schema:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'miRNA';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This part of the query instructs SQLite to count all rows that meet the specified criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**:  We are querying the `features` table, which stores information about genomic features.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'chr10'`**: This filters the results to include only features located on chromosome 10. Remember to replace 'chr10' with the actual name of chromosome 10 in your database if it differs.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'miRNA'`**:  This further filters the results to count only features classified as 'miRNA'.

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to your SQLite3 database.** Use a tool like `sqlite3` or a Python library like `sqlite3`.
2. **Execute the SQL query.** Paste the query into your SQLite3 interface and run it.
3. **Interpret the result.** The query will return a single number representing the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 in your database.
