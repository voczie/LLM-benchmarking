```sql
SELECT attributes 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2');
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **`SELECT attributes`**: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the `attributes` column from the table. The `attributes` column often contains information about the feature, including its biotype.

2. **`FROM features`**:  This indicates that we are querying the `features` table, which stores genomic annotations.

3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: This filters the results to only include rows where the `featuretype` is 'gene'. We're specifically interested in genes.

4. **`AND id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2')`**: This further refines the results by selecting only the rows where the `id` matches the gene names you provided.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The format of the `attributes` column can vary depending on the GFF/GTF file used to create the database. It often uses a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs.
* **Biotype Key:** Look for an attribute named "biotype" or something similar within the `attributes` values. The value associated with this key will tell you the biotype of each gene.
