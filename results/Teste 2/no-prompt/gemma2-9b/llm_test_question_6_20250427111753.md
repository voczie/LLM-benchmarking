Here's how you can find the number of transcript isoforms for the XIST gene and their sizes using SQL queries on your SQLite3 database:

**1. Identify XIST Features:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%';
   ```

   * This query selects all features (rows) from the `features` table where:
      * `featuretype` is 'transcript' (indicating transcripts).
      * `attributes` contains the string `"gene_name "XIST"`. This assumes your GFF/GTF format uses attributes to store gene names.

**2. Count the Transcript Isoforms:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_isoforms
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%';
   ```

   * This query counts the number of rows (transcripts) that match the criteria from step 1. The `COUNT(*)` function returns the total count, and we alias it as `num_isoforms`.

**3. Extract Isoform Names and Sizes:**

   ```sql
   SELECT attributes, end - start + 1 AS size
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%';
   ```

   * This query selects the `attributes` column (which likely contains the transcript name) and calculates the size of each transcript by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position and adding 1.


**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The success of these queries depends on how your GFF/GTF data stores gene names and transcript names within the `attributes` column. You might need to adjust the `LIKE` conditions based on your specific format.
* **Transcript Name Extraction:**  You'll likely need to parse the `attributes` string to extract the specific transcript name. This might involve using regular expressions or string manipulation functions depending on your database system.
