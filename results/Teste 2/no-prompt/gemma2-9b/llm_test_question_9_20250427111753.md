Here's how you can find the average exon size for BRCA1 transcript isoforms using your SQLite3 database schema:

**1. Identify Relevant Features:**

*   You need to focus on features with `featuretype` equal to "exon". 
*   Additionally, filter by `seqid` corresponding to the chromosome where the BRCA1 gene is located. You'll likely need to consult a genome annotation resource or your database schema documentation to determine the specific `seqid`.

**2. Calculate Exon Sizes:**

*   For each exon feature, calculate the difference between `end` and `start` coordinates to get its size.

**3. Average the Exon Sizes:**

*   Sum up all the exon sizes identified in step 2.
*   Divide the sum by the total number of exons found for BRCA1 isoforms.

**SQL Query Example (Conceptual):**

```sql
SELECT AVG(end - start) AS average_exon_size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
  AND seqid = 'chr17' -- Replace with the actual chromosome ID for BRCA1
  AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_id%BRCA1%'; -- Adjust the attribute filter as needed
```

**Explanation:**

*   `AVG(end - start)`: Calculates the average of the differences between `end` and `start` coordinates, representing exon sizes.
*   `WHERE featuretype = 'exon'`: Filters for features classified as exons.
*   `AND seqid = 'chr17'`:  Filters for features on chromosome 17 (replace with the correct chromosome ID).
*   `AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_id%BRCA1%'`: Filters for exons associated with BRCA1 transcripts (adjust the attribute filter based on how transcript IDs are stored in your database).

**Important Notes:**

*   Replace `'chr17'` with the actual chromosome ID where BRCA1 is located.
*   Modify the `attributes LIKE` clause to accurately target BRCA1 transcript isoforms based on your database structure. You might need to consult your GFF/GTF file or schema documentation for specific attribute names and values used to identify BRCA1 transcripts.
