**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause:**  Specifies the columns you want to retrieve:
   - `chromosome`: The chromosome name (from `seqid`).
   - `start_position`: The start position of the transcript on the chromosome.
   - `end_position`: The end position of the transcript.
   - `transcript_size`: Calculated as `end - start + 1`.
   - `num_exons`: Counts distinct exon IDs using a CASE statement and COUNT(DISTINCT).
   - `avg_exon_size`: Calculates the average size of exons.
   - `strand`: The strand (+ or -) of the transcript.
   - `biotype`: Extracts the biotype from the `attributes` column using SUBSTRING and INSTR.

2. **FROM Clause:**  Specifies the table you're querying (`features`).

3. **JOIN Clause:** Joins the `features` table with the `relations` table to link transcripts (children) to their parent genes.

4. **WHERE Clause:** Filters the results based on the parent gene names:
   - `r.parent IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', ...)` selects only transcripts associated with your specified genes.

5. **GROUP BY Clause:** Groups the results by transcript ID, chromosome, start position, and end position to ensure you get one row per transcript.



**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The `SUBSTRING` function assumes that the biotype is stored in the `attributes` column with a specific format (e.g., `"biotype=protein_coding"`). Adjust this if your attribute format is different.
* **Exon Identification:** This query assumes that exons are identified by a feature type of 'exon'. If your data uses a different feature type, modify the `CASE` statements accordingly.
