Here's how you can find the chromosomes containing the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB using your SQLite3 database:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%NFKB1%'
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%NFKB2%'
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%REL%'
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%RELA%'
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%RELB%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT seqid`**: This selects the unique chromosome identifiers (likely named like "chr1", "chr2", etc.) from your database.
2. **`FROM features`**: We are querying the `features` table where gene annotations are stored.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**:  We filter for entries that represent genes.
4. **`AND attributes LIKE '%NFKB1%' ...`**: These lines use the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) to search for genes containing specific gene names within their attributes.

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to your SQLite3 database.** Use a tool like `sqlite3` in your terminal or a GUI database client.
2. **Execute the SQL query.** Paste the query into your database client and run it.
3. **Analyze the results.** The query will return a list of unique chromosome identifiers where each of the target genes (NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB) is located.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:**  The exact format of the `attributes` field in your database will determine how you search for gene names. If it's a structured format (e.g., key-value pairs), you might need to adjust the query accordingly.
* **Case Sensitivity:** Be mindful of case sensitivity when searching within attributes.
