Let's break down how to generate a stacked bar plot representing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome using your SQLite database schema.

**1. Data Extraction:**

* **Identify Feature Types:** You need to filter your `features` table based on the `featuretype` column.  
    * Protein-coding:  Assume this is represented by a specific value (e.g., "gene", "CDS").
    * lncRNA: Look for a specific value representing long non-coding RNA genes.
    * miRNA: Find the value indicating microRNA genes.

* **Group by Chromosome:** Use the `seqid` column to group your features by chromosome.

* **Count Features:** For each chromosome and feature type, count the number of occurrences.

**SQL Query Example (Illustrative):**

```sql
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    'Protein-coding' AS feature_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'  -- Replace with your protein-coding value
GROUP BY seqid;

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    'lncRNA' AS feature_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'lncRNA' -- Replace with your lncRNA value
GROUP BY seqid;

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    'miRNA' AS feature_type,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'miRNA'  -- Replace with your miRNA value
GROUP BY seqid;
```

**2. Data Visualization (Stacked Bar Plot):**

* **Tools:** You can use various tools for visualization:
    * **Python Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn are excellent choices for creating stacked bar plots in Python.
    * **R:** ggplot2 is a powerful library for data visualization in R.
    * **Spreadsheet Software:** Tools like Excel or Google Sheets can also generate basic stacked bar plots.

* **Data Preparation:** Your SQL query results will provide the data you need: chromosome, feature type, and count. You'll likely need to format this data into a suitable structure for your chosen visualization tool.

**3. Visualization Steps (Python Example with Matplotlib):**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load your SQL query results into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query("YOUR_SQL_QUERY", connection) 

# Group by chromosome and feature type, then sum the counts
grouped_data = df.groupby(['chromosome', 'feature_type'])['count'].sum().reset_index()

# Create the stacked bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Adjust figure size as needed
plt.bar(grouped_data['chromosome'], grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'Protein-coding']['count'], label='Protein-coding')
plt.bar(grouped_data['chromosome'], grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'lncRNA']['count'], bottom=grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'Protein-coding']['count'], label='lncRNA')
plt.bar(grouped_data['chromosome'], grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'miRNA']['count'], bottom=grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'Protein-coding']['count'] + grouped_data[grouped_data['feature_type'] == 'lncRNA']['count'], label='miRNA')

plt.xlabel('Chromosome')
plt.ylabel('Gene Count')
plt.title('Proportions of Gene Types on Each Chromosome')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```



**Important Notes:**

* **Replace Placeholders:**  Make sure to replace the placeholder values (`'gene'`, `'lncRNA'`, `'miRNA'`) with the actual values used in your database for these feature types.
* **Database Connection:** You'll need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database before executing the SQL query. Refer to Python's `sqlite3` module documentation for connection details.
