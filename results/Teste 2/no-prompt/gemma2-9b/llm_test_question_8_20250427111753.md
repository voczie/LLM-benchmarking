Here's a breakdown of how to query your SQLite database to find the number of exons per transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds the core genomic annotation data.  Look for entries where `featuretype` is "exon" and identify which ones belong to transcripts of the BRCA1 gene.
* **`attributes` Column:** This column often contains key-value pairs describing the feature. You'll likely find information about transcript isoforms (e.g., "transcript_name") within these attributes.

**SQL Query Walkthrough**

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.attributes, -- Extract all attributes for each exon
    COUNT(DISTINCT f2.id) AS num_exons  -- Count distinct exons per transcript
FROM features AS f1
JOIN features AS f2 ON f1.attributes LIKE '%transcript_name:"%BRCA1 transcript%"' 
   AND f2.attributes LIKE '%transcript_name:"%BRCA1 transcript%"' -- Join exons to the same transcript
GROUP BY f1.attributes; -- Group by transcript name to get exon counts per transcript

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT ... FROM features AS f1 JOIN features AS f2 ...`**: We're joining the `features` table with itself (aliased as `f1` and `f2`) to relate exons to their corresponding transcripts.
2. **`ON f1.attributes LIKE '%transcript_name:"%BRCA1 transcript%"' AND f2.attributes LIKE '%transcript_name:"%BRCA1 transcript%"'`**: This condition joins exons (`f2`) with the transcript they belong to (`f1`). It uses `LIKE` to search for attributes containing "transcript_name" and the string "BRCA1 transcript". Adjust this pattern if your attribute names are different.
3. **`COUNT(DISTINCT f2.id) AS num_exons`**: This counts the distinct exon IDs (`f2.id`) within each group, giving us the number of exons per transcript.
4. **`GROUP BY f1.attributes`**: We group the results by the `attributes` column of `f1`, which contains information about the transcript (including its name).

**Output:**

The query will return a table with two columns:

* **`attributes`**: This column will contain the attributes for each BRCA1 transcript, including the transcript name.
* **`num_exons`**: This column will show the number of exons associated with each transcript isoform.
