Here's how you can find the number of exons in the XIST gene using your SQLite3 database schema:

**1. Understand the GFF/GTF Format:**

* **featuretype:** This field is crucial. Look for entries where `featuretype` is "exon".
* **Attributes:** Exon features often have attributes like "Parent" or "ID" that can help you identify them within a gene.

**2. Construct Your Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'XIST' -- Replace 'XIST' with the actual sequence ID of the XIST gene
  AND featuretype = 'exon';
```

**Explanation:**

* **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet our criteria.
* **`FROM features`**: We're querying the `features` table where gene annotation data is stored.
* **`WHERE seqid = 'XIST'`**:  This filters for entries belonging to the XIST gene. Make sure to replace 'XIST' with the correct sequence ID from your database.
* **`AND featuretype = 'exon'`**: This further filters for rows where the feature type is "exon".

**3. Execute the Query:**

Run this query in your SQLite3 client or environment. The result will be a single number representing the total count of exons found for the XIST gene in your database.
