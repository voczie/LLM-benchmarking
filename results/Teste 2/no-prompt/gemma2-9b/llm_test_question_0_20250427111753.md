Here's how you can find the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 using your SQLite database schema:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table stores information about genomic features.  You'll likely have entries for both genes (often annotated with "gene" as `featuretype`) and transcripts (often annotated with "transcript", "mRNA", or similar).
* **`seqid` Column:** This column identifies the chromosome.

**The Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_genes
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype = 'gene';

SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_transcripts
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype IN ('transcript', 'mRNA'); 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_genes`:** This counts all rows that meet the specified criteria and labels the result as "num_genes".
2. **`FROM features`:**  We're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE seqid = '3'`:** This filters for features on chromosome 3.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`:** This further filters for entries classified as "genes".

   Repeat these steps for transcripts, changing `featuretype` to include relevant transcript annotations like "transcript", "mRNA", etc.

**Running the Query**

1. Connect to your SQLite database using a tool like `sqlite3`.
2. Execute each query separately. The results will show you the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.
