Here's how you can find the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 using your SQLite3 database:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr7' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that match the specified criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**:  We're querying the `features` table, which stores your genome annotation data.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'chr7'`**:  This filters for features located on chromosome 7. Remember to adjust this if your chromosomes are named differently (e.g., 'chromosome7').
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**: This further narrows the results to only gene features.
5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%'`**: This is crucial! It uses the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) to search for any feature where the `attributes` field contains the string "lncRNA".  This assumes your annotation format includes information about lncRNA genes within the `attributes` field.

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to your database:** Use a SQLite3 client or tool to connect to your database file.
2. **Execute the query:** Paste the SQL query into your client and run it.
3. **Interpret the result:** The query will return a single number representing the count of lncRNA genes found on chromosome 7 according to your annotation data.
