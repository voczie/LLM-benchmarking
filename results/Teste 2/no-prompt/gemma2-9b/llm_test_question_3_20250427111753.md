Here's how you can find the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome using your SQLite database schema:

**1.  Identify Pseudogenes:**

*   You need to determine how "pseudogene" is represented in your `attributes` column. 
    *   Look for a specific attribute name (e.g., `"gene_type": "pseudogene"`) or a keyword within the attributes that consistently indicates pseudogenes.

**2.  Filter by Chromosome:**

*   Use the `seqid` column to filter for entries on the X chromosome. Replace `"X"` with the actual identifier used in your database for the X chromosome.

**3.  Count the Results:**

*   Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of rows that meet both criteria (pseudogene classification and X chromosome location).

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' 
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_type": "pseudogene"%'; -- Adjust attribute search as needed
```

**Explanation:**

*   `SELECT COUNT(*)`: Counts all rows that match the conditions.
*   `FROM features`: Specifies the table to query.
*   `WHERE seqid = 'X'`: Filters for entries on the X chromosome.
*   `AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_type": "pseudogene"%'`:  Filters for entries where the `attributes` column contains the specific pseudogene indicator (adjust this part based on your actual attribute structure).

**Important Notes:**

*   Replace `"X"` with the correct identifier for the X chromosome in your database.
*   Modify the `LIKE` clause to accurately match how "pseudogene" is represented in your `attributes` column.
