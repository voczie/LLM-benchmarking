Here's how you can find the genes located immediately before and after COL1A2 using SQL queries on your GFF/GTF database:

**Understanding the Challenge**

The key is to leverage the ordering of features within the `features` table based on their `start` positions.  We'll need to:

1. **Identify COL1A2:** Find the row in the `features` table where `featuretype` is 'gene' and the gene name matches 'COL1A2'.
2. **Find the Previous Gene:** Locate the gene with a lower `start` position than COL1A2, but still within a reasonable proximity (you might need to adjust this based on your genome size).
3. **Find the Next Gene:**  Locate the gene with a higher `start` position than COL1A2.

**SQL Query Walkthrough**

```sql
-- 1. Find COL1A2
SELECT *
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%';

-- 2. Find the gene before COL1A2
SELECT f.*
FROM features AS f
JOIN (
    SELECT id, start
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%'
) AS col1a2 ON f.start < col1a2.start
ORDER BY f.start DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 3. Find the gene after COL1A2
SELECT f.*
FROM features AS f
JOIN (
    SELECT id, start
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%'
) AS col1a2 ON f.start > col1a2.start
ORDER BY f.start ASC
LIMIT 1;

```

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** This query isolates the row for COL1A2 based on its gene type and name.
* **Step 2:**  We use a subquery to get the `id` and `start` position of COL1A2. Then, we join it with the main `features` table (`f`) to find genes (`f`) whose `start` positions are *less than* COL1A2's start position. We order by `start` in descending order (`DESC`) to get the closest gene before COL1A2 and limit the result to 1 row.
* **Step 3:**  Similar to Step 2, but we filter for genes whose `start` positions are *greater than* COL1A2's start position, ordering by ascending `start` (`ASC`) to get the closest gene after COL1A2 and limiting to 1 row.

**Important Notes:**

* **Adjust Proximity:** The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures you get only one preceding/following gene. You might need to adjust this limit or add additional filtering based on your genome size and the expected spacing between genes.
* **Gene Name Variations:** If there are different ways COL1A2 is represented in the attributes (e.g., 'COL1A2', 'Col1a2'), you'll need to modify the `LIKE` conditions accordingly.
