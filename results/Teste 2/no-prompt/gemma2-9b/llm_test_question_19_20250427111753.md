Here's a breakdown of how you can generate a boxplot comparing the sizes (end - start) of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts using your SQLite database.

**1. Data Extraction:**

   * **Query:**

     ```sql
     SELECT 
         featuretype,
         (end - start) AS transcript_size
     FROM features
     WHERE featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
     GROUP BY featuretype;
     ```

   * **Explanation:**
      * `SELECT featuretype, (end - start) AS transcript_size`:  Selects the feature type and calculates the size of each transcript by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position.
      * `FROM features`: Specifies the table to query.
      * `WHERE featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')`: Filters for transcripts belonging to the desired categories.
      * `GROUP BY featuretype`: Groups the results by transcript type, allowing you to calculate size statistics for each category separately.

**2. Data Visualization (Using Python):**

   * **Libraries:** You'll need libraries like `sqlite3` (for database interaction) and `matplotlib.pyplot` (for plotting).
   * **Code Example (Python):**

     ```python
     import sqlite3
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file
     cursor = conn.cursor()

     cursor.execute("""
         SELECT 
             featuretype,
             (end - start) AS transcript_size
         FROM features
         WHERE featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
         GROUP BY featuretype
     """)

     data = cursor.fetchall()
     conn.close()

     # Extract data for plotting
     types = [row[0] for row in data]
     sizes = [row[1] for row in data]

     plt.boxplot(sizes, labels=types)
     plt.title('Comparison of Transcript Sizes by Type')
     plt.xlabel('Transcript Type')
     plt.ylabel('Transcript Size (bp)')
     plt.show() 
     ```

**Key Points:**

* **Database Connection:** Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
* **Data Interpretation:** The boxplot will visually show the distribution of transcript sizes for each category, including quartiles (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles), median, and potential outliers.
