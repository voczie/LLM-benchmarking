Here's how you can find genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands using SQL queries against your GFF/GTF database:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to identify genes that fall within a specific genomic region defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12.  The key is to consider both positive (+) and negative (-) strands.

**SQL Queries**

```sql
-- Genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the + strand
SELECT * 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_id' -- Replace with your actual genome sequence ID
  AND featuretype = 'gene' -- Filter for genes
  AND start BETWEEN (SELECT end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11') AND (SELECT end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12')
  AND strand = '+'

-- Genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the - strand
SELECT * 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_id' -- Replace with your actual genome sequence ID
  AND featuretype = 'gene' -- Filter for genes
  AND end BETWEEN (SELECT start FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11') AND (SELECT start FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12')
  AND strand = '-';

```

**Explanation:**

* **`seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_id'`**: Replace `'your_genome_sequence_id'` with the actual ID of your genome sequence in the database.
* **`featuretype = 'gene'`**: This ensures you only retrieve gene annotations.
* **`start BETWEEN ... AND ...`**:  For the + strand, we look for genes whose start position falls within the range defined by HOXC11's end and HOXC12's end.
* **`end BETWEEN ... AND ...`**: For the - strand, we look for genes whose end position falls within the range defined by HOXC11's start and HOXC12's start.
* **`strand = '+'` or `strand = '-'`**:  Filters for genes on the desired strand.

**Important Notes:**

* **Genome Sequence ID:** Make sure to replace `'your_genome_sequence_id'` with the correct ID from your database.
* **Gene IDs:** Ensure that 'HOXC11' and 'HOXC12' are the actual IDs of these genes in your database.
