Here's how you can find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using your SQLite3 database schema:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT start, end 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT start, end`**: This specifies that we want to retrieve the `start` and `end` columns from the `features` table. These columns represent the beginning and ending positions of a genomic feature on the chromosome.

2. **`FROM features`**:  This indicates that we are querying the `features` table, which stores information about genomic features like genes.

3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: This filters the results to only include rows where the `featuretype` is 'gene'. We're specifically interested in gene annotations.

4. **`AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'`**: This further refines the results by looking for genes whose `attributes` contain the string 'BRCA1'.  The `LIKE` operator with the wildcard '%' allows us to find partial matches, ensuring we capture the BRCA1 gene even if its attribute description isn't exactly "BRCA1".

**Running the Query:**

* Connect to your SQLite3 database.
* Execute the SQL query. 
* The result will be a table showing the `start` and `end` positions of the BRCA1 gene on the chromosome.
