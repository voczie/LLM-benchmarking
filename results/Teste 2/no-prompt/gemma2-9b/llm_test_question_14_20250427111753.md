Here's how you can find the strands of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes using your SQLite3 database:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT featuretype, strand 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_ID' -- Replace with the actual ID of your genome sequence
  AND (featuretype = 'gene' AND (name LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR name LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR name LIKE '%HOXC12%')) 
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Identify Your Genome Sequence:** Replace `'your_genome_sequence_ID'` with the actual ID of your genome sequence in the database. You can find this information in the `meta` table or by examining the `seqid` column in the `features` table.
2. **Target Specific Genes:** The query uses `featuretype = 'gene'` to focus on genes and then employs `name LIKE '%HOTAIR%'`, `name LIKE '%HOXC11%'`, and `name LIKE '%HOXC12%'` to match the gene names you're interested in. Adjust these patterns if your gene names are stored differently.
3. **Extract Strand Information:** The query selects the `strand` column, which will contain either '+' (positive strand) or '-' (negative strand) for each matching gene.

**Important Notes:**

* **Case Sensitivity:**  SQL queries can be case-sensitive depending on your database settings. Ensure that your gene names and comparisons are consistent in terms of capitalization.
* **Gene Naming Conventions:** If your gene names are stored using different conventions (e.g., abbreviations, full names), modify the `LIKE` patterns accordingly.
