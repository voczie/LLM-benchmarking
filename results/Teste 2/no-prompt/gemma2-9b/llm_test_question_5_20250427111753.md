```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    end - start + 1 AS gene_size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND (
    -- Check for each gene individually
    (source LIKE '%XIST%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%MALAT1%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%BRCA1%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%COL1A2%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%NFKB1%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%NFKB2%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%REL%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%RELA%') 
    OR (source LIKE '%RELB%')
  )
ORDER BY featuretype;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT featuretype, end - start + 1 AS gene_size`**: This selects the `featuretype` column and calculates the size of each feature by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position and adding 1. We alias this calculated value as `gene_size`.

2. **`FROM features`**:  This specifies that we are querying the `features` table.

3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: This filters the results to include only rows where the `featuretype` is 'gene'.

4. **`AND ( ... )`**: This introduces a logical AND condition to further filter the results based on the gene names.

5. **`source LIKE '%XIST%'` OR ...**:  Each line within the parentheses checks if the `source` column contains a specific gene name using the `LIKE` operator and wildcard characters (`%`). 
   - Replace `%XIST%`, `%MALAT1%`, etc., with the actual names you want to query.

6. **`ORDER BY featuretype`**: This sorts the results alphabetically by `featuretype`.



**Important Notes:**

*  Make sure your database schema matches the provided example.
* Adjust the gene names within the `LIKE` conditions to match your specific requirements.
