To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the XIST Gene**: First, you need to find the ID or attributes associated with the XIST gene in the `features` table. The `featuretype` for genes is typically "gene".

2. **Find Exons Associated with the XIST Gene**: Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, you can query the `features` table again to count the number of exons associated with that gene. Exons are typically marked with the `featuretype` "exon".

3. **Construct the SQL Queries**: You will need to write SQL queries to perform the above steps.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Find the XIST Gene ID

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%';
```

This query will return the ID of the XIST gene. Make sure to check the `attributes` column for the exact name or identifier of the gene.

### Step 2: Count the Exons for the XIST Gene

Assuming you found the ID of the XIST gene (let's say it's `xist_gene_id`), you can now count the exons:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS exon_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND attributes LIKE '%xist_gene_id%';
```

### Complete Walkthrough

1. **Run the first query** to get the ID of the XIST gene.
2. **Take note of the ID** returned from the first query.
3. **Replace `xist_gene_id`** in the second query with the actual ID you retrieved.
4. **Run the second query** to get the count of exons.

### Example

If the first query returns an ID like `gene_XIST_1`, your second query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS exon_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_XIST_1%';
```

### Final Note

Make sure to adjust the `LIKE` clause in the queries based on how the attributes are formatted in your database. The `%` wildcard allows for partial matches, which is useful if the ID is part of a longer string.
