To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has and to print the transcript isoform names along with their sizes, you can follow these steps using SQL queries on the SQLite database that contains the genome annotation data.

### Step 1: Identify the XIST Gene

First, you need to find the feature ID or attributes associated with the XIST gene. Typically, genes are represented in the GFF/GTF format with a feature type of "gene". You can query the `features` table to find the ID of the XIST gene.

```sql
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%';
```

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms

Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, you can find its associated transcript isoforms. Transcript isoforms are usually represented with a feature type of "transcript". You will need to use the `relations` table to find the relationship between the gene and its transcripts.

Assuming the ID of the XIST gene is `xist_gene_id`, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT f.id AS transcript_id, f.attributes 
FROM features f
JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child 
WHERE r.parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND r.level = 1 AND f.featuretype = 'transcript';
```

### Step 3: Calculate Sizes of Each Transcript Isoform

To calculate the size of each transcript isoform, you can use the `start` and `end` columns from the `features` table. The size can be calculated as `end - start + 1`.

You can modify the previous query to include the size calculation:

```sql
SELECT f.id AS transcript_id, f.attributes, (f.end - f.start + 1) AS size 
FROM features f
JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child 
WHERE r.parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND r.level = 1 AND f.featuretype = 'transcript';
```

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run the final query in your SQLite database to get the transcript isoform names and their sizes. The `attributes` field typically contains the transcript name, which you can extract from it.

### Example of Final Query

Hereâ€™s a complete example of the SQL query you might use:

```sql
SELECT f.id AS transcript_id, 
       f.attributes, 
       (f.end - f.start + 1) AS size 
FROM features f
JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child 
WHERE r.parent = (SELECT id 
                  FROM features 
                  WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%') 
      AND r.level = 1 
      AND f.featuretype = 'transcript';
```

### Conclusion

After executing the above query, you will receive a list of transcript isoform IDs, their names (from the `attributes` field), and their sizes. You can then count the number of rows returned to determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has.
