To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Gene Data**: First, you need to query the database to get the gene features located on the X chromosome. You will calculate the size of each gene by subtracting the start position from the end position.

2. **Prepare the Data**: Once you have the gene sizes, you will prepare the data for visualization.

3. **Create the Scatterplot**: Finally, you will use a plotting library (like Matplotlib in Python) to create the scatterplot.

### Step 1: Query the Database

You can use the following SQL query to extract the gene features from the `features` table for the X chromosome:

```sql
SELECT 
    id, 
    (end - start) AS gene_size 
FROM 
    features 
WHERE 
    seqid = 'X' AND 
    featuretype = 'gene';
```

This query selects the `id` of each gene and calculates the `gene_size` by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position for genes located on the X chromosome.

### Step 2: Execute the Query and Prepare Data

Assuming you are using Python with the `sqlite3` library, you can execute the query and prepare the data as follows:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT 
    id, 
    (end - start) AS gene_size 
FROM 
    features 
WHERE 
    seqid = 'X' AND 
    featuretype = 'gene';
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()

# Prepare data for plotting
gene_ids = [row[0] for row in results]  # Extract gene IDs
gene_sizes = [row[1] for row in results]  # Extract gene sizes
```

### Step 3: Create the Scatterplot

Now that you have the gene sizes, you can create a scatterplot using Matplotlib:

```python
# Create a scatterplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(gene_ids, gene_sizes, alpha=0.6)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on the X Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Gene ID')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better visibility
plt.grid()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Summary

1. You queried the database to get gene sizes on the X chromosome.
2. You prepared the data for visualization.
3. You created a scatterplot to visualize the distribution of gene sizes.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. Additionally, you may want to adjust the figure size and other plot parameters to suit your preferences.
