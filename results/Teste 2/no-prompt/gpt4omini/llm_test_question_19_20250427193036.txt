To generate a boxplot comparing the sizes of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts from your SQLite database, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Data**: You need to write a SQL query to extract the relevant data from the `features` table. Specifically, you want to filter for the feature types that correspond to protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts, and then calculate their sizes.

2. **Calculate Transcript Sizes**: The size of each transcript can be calculated as the difference between the `end` and `start` columns.

3. **Load the Data into a DataFrame**: Use a programming language like Python with libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create the boxplot.

### Step 1: SQL Query

Here’s a SQL query that will extract the necessary data:

```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start) AS size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA');
```

### Step 2: Execute the Query and Load Data

You can use Python to execute this query and load the data into a DataFrame. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Execute the SQL query
query = """
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start) AS size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA');
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Generate the Boxplot

Now that you have the data in a DataFrame, you can create a boxplot using seaborn or matplotlib:

```python
# Set the aesthetic style of the plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create the boxplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='featuretype', y='size', data=df)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Comparison of Transcript Sizes')
plt.xlabel('Transcript Type')
plt.ylabel('Transcript Size (bp)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Summary

1. You wrote a SQL query to extract the sizes of the specified transcript types.
2. You executed the query and loaded the results into a pandas DataFrame.
3. You used seaborn to create a boxplot comparing the sizes of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This process will give you a visual representation of the size distributions for the different transcript types.
