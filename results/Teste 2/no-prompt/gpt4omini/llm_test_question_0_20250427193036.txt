To answer the question of how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to query the `features` table. In GFF/GTF format, genes and transcripts are typically represented by specific feature types. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to construct the SQL queries:

### Step 1: Identify Feature Types
In the GFF/GTF format:
- Genes are usually represented by the feature type "gene".
- Transcripts are usually represented by the feature type "transcript".

### Step 2: Write SQL Queries
You will need to write two separate queries: one to count the number of genes and another to count the number of transcripts on chromosome 3.

#### Query to Count Genes
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

#### Query to Count Transcripts
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'transcript';
```

### Step 3: Execute the Queries
You can execute these queries using a SQLite client or a programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module).

### Step 4: Combine Results
If you want to combine the results into a single output, you can use a single query with a `UNION` or run both queries separately and then combine the results in your application logic.

#### Combined Query Example
```sql
SELECT 'gene' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene'
GROUP BY feature_type

UNION ALL

SELECT 'transcript' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'transcript'
GROUP BY feature_type;
```

### Summary
1. Identify the feature types for genes and transcripts.
2. Write and execute SQL queries to count each feature type on chromosome 3.
3. Optionally, combine the results for a consolidated view.

This approach will give you the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 from your SQLite database.
