To find the genes located between the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes on both the + and - strands, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12**: First, you need to retrieve the start and end positions of both genes from the `features` table.

2. **Find genes between the two identified genes**: Once you have the positions, you can query the `features` table again to find genes that are located between these two positions on both strands.

Here’s how you can do this step-by-step with SQL queries:

### Step 1: Retrieve Positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12

You can use the following SQL query to get the start and end positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12:

```sql
SELECT seqid, featuretype, start, end, strand
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (id = 'HOXC11' OR id = 'HOXC12');
```

### Step 2: Find Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12

Assuming you have the results from the previous query, you can then use those positions to find the genes located between them. You will need to check both strands separately.

Here’s an example query that assumes you have the start and end positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12:

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT id, start, end, strand
    FROM features
    WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
),
hoxc11 AS (
    SELECT start AS start_pos, end AS end_pos, strand
    FROM hoxc_positions
    WHERE id = 'HOXC11'
),
hoxc12 AS (
    SELECT start AS start_pos, end AS end_pos, strand
    FROM hoxc_positions
    WHERE id = 'HOXC12'
)

SELECT f.id, f.start, f.end, f.strand
FROM features f
JOIN hoxc11 h11 ON f.strand = h11.strand
JOIN hoxc12 h12 ON f.strand = h12.strand
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
AND (
    (h11.start_pos < f.start AND f.start < h12.start_pos) OR
    (h12.start_pos < f.start AND f.start < h11.start_pos)
);
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The `hoxc_positions` CTE retrieves the start and end positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12. The `hoxc11` and `hoxc12` CTEs extract the specific start and end positions for each gene.

2. **Main Query**: The main query selects genes from the `features` table that are on the same strand as either HOXC11 or HOXC12 and checks if their start position is between the start and end positions of the two genes.

### Note:
- Make sure to adjust the conditions in the `WHERE` clause if you want to include the boundaries (i.e., whether you want to include genes that start exactly at the end of HOXC11 or at the start of HOXC12).
- If you want to handle cases where HOXC11 and HOXC12 are on different strands, you may need to modify the logic accordingly.
