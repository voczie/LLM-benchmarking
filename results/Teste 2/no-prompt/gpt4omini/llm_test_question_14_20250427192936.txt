To find out the strands on which the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located in your SQLite database, you can execute a SQL query that selects the relevant information from the `features` table. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Connect to the SQLite Database
Make sure you have access to the SQLite database where your genome annotation data is stored. You can use a SQLite client or a programming language like Python with the `sqlite3` module.

### Step 2: Write the SQL Query
You need to write a SQL query that retrieves the `strand` information for the specified genes. The `features` table contains the necessary information, and you can filter the results based on the `featuretype` (which is typically "gene") and the `attributes` column (which contains the gene names).

Here’s a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes`: This selects the sequence ID, feature type, strand, and attributes from the `features` table.
- `FROM features`: This specifies the table to query.
- `WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`: This filters the results to include only rows where the feature type is 'gene'.
- `AND attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%'`: This further filters the results to include only those genes that match HOTAIR, HOXC11, or HOXC12.

### Step 3: Execute the Query
Run the query in your SQLite environment. If you are using Python, it might look something like this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%');
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Step 4: Interpret the Results
The output will show you the sequence ID, feature type, strand, and attributes for each of the specified genes. The `strand` column will indicate whether each gene is located on the '+' (plus) or '-' (minus) strand of the DNA.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to determine the strands on which the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located in your SQLite database.
