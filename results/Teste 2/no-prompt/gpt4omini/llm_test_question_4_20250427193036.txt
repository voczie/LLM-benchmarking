To find out how many genes for miRNA exist in chromosome 10 using the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to query the `features` table. The `featuretype` column will help you identify the miRNA genes, and the `seqid` column will allow you to filter for chromosome 10.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: You need to focus on the `seqid` and `featuretype` columns in the `features` table. The `seqid` should match "chr10" (or "10" depending on how chromosomes are labeled in your database), and the `featuretype` should match "miRNA".

2. **Construct the SQL query**: You will use a `SELECT` statement with a `COUNT` function to count the number of entries that match your criteria.

Here’s the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'miRNA';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_count`: This part of the query counts all rows that match the criteria and labels the result as `miRNA_count`.
- `FROM features`: This specifies that you are querying the `features` table.
- `WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'miRNA'`: This filters the results to only include rows where the `seqid` is "chr10" and the `featuretype` is "miRNA".

### Executing the Query:
You can execute this query using a SQLite client or any programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). Here’s an example of how you might do it in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_count
    FROM features
    WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'miRNA';
""")

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
miRNA_count = result[0]

# Print the result
print(f"Number of miRNA genes in chromosome 10: {miRNA_count}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will connect to the database, execute the query, and print the number of miRNA genes found on chromosome 10.
