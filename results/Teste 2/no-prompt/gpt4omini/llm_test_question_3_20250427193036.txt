To find out how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome in your SQLite database, you can use a SQL query to count the entries in the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'pseudogene' and the `seqid` is 'X'. 

Here’s a step-by-step guide to formulating the query:

1. **Identify the relevant table**: You need to query the `features` table since it contains the genomic features, including pseudogenes.

2. **Specify the conditions**: You want to filter the results to only include rows where:
   - `featuretype` is 'pseudogene'
   - `seqid` is 'X' (indicating the X chromosome)

3. **Count the results**: Use the `COUNT()` function to get the total number of pseudogenes that meet the criteria.

Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count`: This part of the query counts all rows that match the criteria and labels the result as `pseudogene_count`.
- `FROM features`: This specifies that you are querying the `features` table.
- `WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X'`: This filters the results to only include rows where the feature type is 'pseudogene' and the sequence ID is 'X'.

### Executing the Query:
To execute this query, you can use a SQLite client or a programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). Here’s an example of how you might do it in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
""")

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will print the number of pseudogenes found on the X chromosome.
