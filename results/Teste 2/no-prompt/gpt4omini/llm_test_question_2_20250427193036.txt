To find out how many lncRNA genes are on chromosome 7 using the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to query the `features` table. The `featuretype` column will help you identify lncRNA genes, and the `seqid` column will allow you to filter for chromosome 7.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to constructing the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: You need to focus on the `seqid` and `featuretype` columns in the `features` table.
2. **Filter for chromosome 7**: You will filter the `seqid` column to match "chr7" (or "7" depending on how chromosomes are labeled in your dataset).
3. **Filter for lncRNA genes**: You will filter the `featuretype` column to match "lncRNA".

### SQL Query

Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr7' AND featuretype = 'lncRNA';
```

### Explanation of the Query

- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count`: This part of the query counts the number of rows that match the criteria and labels the result as `lncRNA_count`.
- `FROM features`: This specifies that we are querying the `features` table.
- `WHERE seqid = 'chr7'`: This filters the results to only include entries where the `seqid` is "chr7".
- `AND featuretype = 'lncRNA'`: This further filters the results to only include entries where the `featuretype` is "lncRNA".

### Execution

To execute this query, you would typically use a SQLite client or a programming language that can interface with SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). Here’s an example of how you might do this in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count
    FROM features
    WHERE seqid = 'chr7' AND featuretype = 'lncRNA';
""")

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
lncRNA_count = result[0]

# Print the result
print(f'The number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 is: {lncRNA_count}')

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will connect to the database, execute the query, and print the number of lncRNA genes found on chromosome 7.
