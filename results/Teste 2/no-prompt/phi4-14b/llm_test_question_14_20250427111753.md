To determine the strand location of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes using your SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Gene IDs

First, you need to identify the unique identifiers (IDs) for the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes. These IDs are typically stored in the `attributes` column of the `features` table. The attributes field often contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons, with each pair formatted as `key "value"`. For gene names, you might find something like `gene_name "HOTAIR"`.

### Step 2: Query to Extract Gene IDs

You can use a query to extract the IDs of these genes based on their names. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOTAIR"%'
   OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOXC11"%'
   OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOXC12"%';
```

This query will return the IDs of the genes HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12.

### Step 3: Query to Get Strand Information

Once you have the gene IDs, you can use them to find out on which strand each gene is located. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT id, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id 
    FROM features 
    WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOTAIR"%'
       OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOXC11"%'
       OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name "HOXC12"%'
);
```

This query will return the ID and strand for each of the specified genes.

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: We identify the gene names within the `attributes` column using a pattern match (`LIKE`) to find entries containing `gene_name "HOTAIR"`, `gene_name "HOXC11"`, or `gene_name "HOXC12"`.

- **Step 2**: We extract the IDs of these genes by querying the `features` table where the `attributes` column matches the gene names.

- **Step 3**: Using the extracted IDs, we query again to get the strand information for each gene. The `strand` column indicates whether the gene is on the positive (`+`) or negative (`-`) strand.

By following these steps, you will be able to determine the strand location of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes in your database.
