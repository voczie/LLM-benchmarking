To determine how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, you'll need to perform a series of SQL queries on your SQLite database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Identify the BRCA1 Gene

First, we need to identify the ID(s) associated with the BRCA1 gene. This can be done by querying the `features` table for entries where the `featuretype` is "gene" and the `attributes` column contains "BRCA1".

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

This query will return the IDs of all gene entries related to BRCA1.

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms

Next, we need to find all transcript isoforms associated with each BRCA1 gene ID. This involves querying the `relations` table to find children features (transcripts) for each parent gene ID obtained in Step 1.

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent IN (
    SELECT id 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'
) AND level = 1;
```

This query will return the IDs of all transcript isoforms related to the BRCA1 gene.

### Step 3: Count Exons for Each Transcript Isoform

Now, we need to count the number of exons associated with each transcript isoform. This involves querying the `relations` table again to find children features (exons) for each parent transcript ID obtained in Step 2.

```sql
SELECT 
    r.parent AS transcript_id,
    COUNT(r.child) AS exon_count
FROM relations r
WHERE r.parent IN (
    SELECT child 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent IN (
        SELECT id 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'
    ) AND level = 1
) AND r.level = 2
GROUP BY r.parent;
```

This query will return each transcript ID and the count of its associated exons.

### Step 4: Retrieve Transcript Names

Finally, we need to retrieve the names of these transcripts from the `features` table. The `attributes` column typically contains a key-value pair for the transcript name, often in the format `transcript_name "XYZ"`.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.id AS transcript_id,
    SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'transcript_name "') + 17) AS transcript_name,
    e.exon_count
FROM features f
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        r.parent AS transcript_id,
        COUNT(r.child) AS exon_count
    FROM relations r
    WHERE r.parent IN (
        SELECT child 
        FROM relations 
        WHERE parent IN (
            SELECT id 
            FROM features 
            WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'
        ) AND level = 1
    ) AND r.level = 2
    GROUP BY r.parent
) e ON f.id = e.transcript_id
WHERE f.featuretype = 'mRNA';
```

This query joins the transcript IDs with their exon counts and extracts the transcript names from the `attributes` column. It filters for entries where `featuretype` is "mRNA" to ensure we are only considering transcripts.

### Final Output

The final output will be a list of transcript isoform names (`transcript_name`) along with the number of exons each has:

```plaintext
| transcript_name | exon_count |
|-----------------|------------|
| Transcript1     | 8          |
| Transcript2     | 9          |
| ...             | ...        |
```

This approach ensures you accurately count and list the exons for each BRCA1 transcript isoform. Adjust the substring extraction logic if your `attributes` format differs slightly.
