To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the XIST Gene

First, we need to identify the ID of the XIST gene. This information is typically stored in the `attributes` column of the `features` table. The attributes are usually formatted as key-value pairs separated by semicolons.

#### Query to Find the XIST Gene ID:

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "XIST"%';
```

This query searches for a gene with `featuretype` set to `'gene'` and an attribute containing `gene_id "XIST"`.

### Step 2: Find Exons Related to the XIST Gene

Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, use it to find all related exons. The relationship between genes and their features (like exons) is stored in the `relations` table.

#### Query to Get Exon IDs for the XIST Gene:

Assuming the gene ID from Step 1 is stored in a variable called `xist_gene_id`, you can use it as follows:

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND level = 1;
```

Here, `level = 1` typically indicates direct children of the gene, which are usually exons.

### Step 3: Count the Exons

Finally, count the number of unique exon entries retrieved in the previous step.

#### Query to Count Exons:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT child) AS exon_count 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND level = 1;
```

### Complete Walkthrough

1. **Find XIST Gene ID:**
   - Run the first query to get the `id` of the XIST gene.

2. **Retrieve Exon IDs:**
   - Use the retrieved `id` in place of `'xist_gene_id'` in the second query to get all related exon IDs.

3. **Count Exons:**
   - Execute the third query to count how many exons are associated with the XIST gene.

By following these steps, you will be able to determine the number of exons for the XIST gene stored in your SQLite database.
