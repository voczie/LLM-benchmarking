To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a query that retrieves information from the `features` table. The BRCA1 gene will be identified by its attributes in the GFF/GTF format, typically stored as key-value pairs within the `attributes` column.

Here's a step-by-step guide and SQL query to help you find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene:

### Step 1: Understand the Attributes Column
In GFF/GTF files, the `attributes` column contains metadata about each feature. For genes like BRCA1, this often includes an ID or name field that can be used to identify it.

### Step 2: Identify the Key for BRCA1
You need to determine how the BRCA1 gene is represented in the `attributes` column. It might look something like:
- `ID=BRCA1;Name=BRCA1`
- `gene_id "BRCA1"; gene_name "BRCA1"`

### Step 3: Write the SQL Query
Assuming the attributes are stored as a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, you can use SQLite's string functions to search for the BRCA1 gene. Hereâ€™s an example query:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand
FROM features
WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=BRCA1%' OR attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `seqid`: The chromosome or scaffold name.
- `start` and `end`: The start and end positions on the chromosome.
- `strand`: Indicates the strand (`+` or `-`) where the gene is located.

The query uses the `LIKE` operator to search for patterns in the `attributes` column that match either `ID=BRCA1` or `gene_id "BRCA1"`. Adjust these patterns based on how your data represents the BRCA1 gene.

### Step 4: Execute the Query
Run this query in your SQLite environment. The result will give you the chromosomal position (seqid, start, end) and strand of the BRCA1 gene.

### Additional Considerations:
- If the attributes are stored differently, adjust the `LIKE` patterns accordingly.
- Ensure that the database is properly indexed for performance if dealing with large datasets.
- If there are multiple entries for BRCA1, you might need additional filtering based on other attributes or context.

By following these steps, you should be able to retrieve the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene from your SQLite database.
