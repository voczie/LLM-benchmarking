To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are located on chromosome 7 using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a query that filters for features of type "gene" with attributes indicating they are lncRNAs and restricts the results to those on chromosome 7. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Schema

- **features table**: Contains genomic feature data including `seqid` (chromosome), `featuretype`, and `attributes`.
- **attributes column**: This is typically a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, which might include information about gene type.

### Step 2: Identify lncRNA in Attributes

lncRNAs are often annotated with specific attributes. Commonly used attribute keys for identifying lncRNAs include:
- `gene_type` or similar, with values like "lncRNA".
- Other possible indicators could be found in the `attributes` column.

### Step 3: Construct the Query

You need to filter the `features` table for entries where:
1. The `featuretype` is "gene".
2. The `seqid` (chromosome) is "7".
3. The `attributes` contain a key-value pair indicating it's an lncRNA.

Hereâ€™s how you can construct such a query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_lncRNAs
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND seqid = '7'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type%lncRNA%'
```

### Explanation of the Query

- **`featuretype = 'gene'`**: Ensures we are only looking at gene entries.
- **`seqid = '7'`**: Restricts results to chromosome 7.
- **`attributes LIKE '%gene_type%lncRNA%'`**: Searches for the presence of `gene_type=lncRNA` within the attributes. Adjust this pattern if your database uses a different key or format.

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run the above SQL query in your SQLite environment to get the count of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7.

### Additional Considerations

- **Attribute Format**: Ensure that the `attributes` column is consistently formatted. If it's not, you might need a more complex parsing strategy.
- **Database Indexing**: For performance, ensure there are indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses (`featuretype`, `seqid`, and possibly `attributes`).

This approach should give you the number of lncRNA genes located on chromosome 7. Adjust the attribute key if your database uses a different convention for annotating lncRNAs.
