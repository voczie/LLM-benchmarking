To find which genes are located between the `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` genes on both the positive (+) and negative (-) strands, you can follow these steps using SQL queries. Here's a walkthrough:

### Step 1: Identify the Positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12

First, we need to find the start and end positions for `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`. Assuming that these genes are identified by their IDs in the `attributes` column (e.g., `ID=HOXC11;`), you can use the following queries:

```sql
-- Find HOXC11 position
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11;%';

-- Find HOXC12 position
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12;%';
```

### Step 2: Determine the Range for Each Strand

For each strand (+ and -), determine the range between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`. This depends on their relative positions:

- **Positive Strand (+):** The gene after `HOXC11` and before `HOXC12`.
- **Negative Strand (-):** The gene after `HOXC12` and before `HOXC11`.

### Step 3: Query for Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12

#### Positive Strand (+)

```sql
-- Assuming you have identified the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 as follows:
-- HOXC11_start, HOXC11_end, HOXC12_start, HOXC12_end

SELECT id, seqid, featuretype, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE strand = '+' 
  AND ((start > (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11;%') 
        AND start < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12;%')) 
       OR (end > (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11;%') 
           AND end < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12;%')))
  AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

#### Negative Strand (-)

```sql
-- Assuming you have identified the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 as follows:
-- HOXC11_start, HOXC11_end, HOXC12_start, HOXC12_end

SELECT id, seqid, featuretype, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE strand = '-' 
  AND ((start > (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12;%') 
        AND start < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11;%')) 
       OR (end > (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12;%') 
           AND end < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11;%')))
  AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `attributes` column is parsed correctly to extract gene IDs. The above queries assume a simple pattern match.
- Adjust the conditions based on the actual positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.
- If there are multiple chromosomes or sequences (`seqid`), you may need to filter by the specific chromosome where these genes reside.

This approach will help you identify genes located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands. Adjust the queries as needed based on your database's specific data structure and content.
