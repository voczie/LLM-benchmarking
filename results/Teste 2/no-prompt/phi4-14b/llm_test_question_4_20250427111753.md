To determine how many miRNA genes exist on chromosome 10 using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a SQL query that filters and counts relevant entries from the `features` table. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Schema

- **features**: This table contains genomic features with attributes like `seqid`, `featuretype`, etc.
- **attributes**: This column likely holds additional information in key-value pairs, which might include gene names or types.

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Columns

To find miRNA genes on chromosome 10:
- Use the `seqid` column to filter for chromosome 10.
- Use the `featuretype` column to identify features of type "miRNA".
- Parse the `attributes` column to confirm if they are indeed miRNA genes.

### Step 3: Construct the SQL Query

Assuming the `attributes` column contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons and keys/values by equals signs, you can use SQLite's string functions to parse it. Hereâ€™s a query that does this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '10'  -- Assuming '10' is the identifier for chromosome 10
AND featuretype = 'miRNA'
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type=mirna%';  -- Adjust based on actual attribute format
```

### Explanation

- **seqid = '10'**: Filters features to only those on chromosome 10.
- **featuretype = 'miRNA'**: Ensures the feature type is miRNA.
- **attributes LIKE '%gene_type=mirna%'**: Checks if the attributes indicate a gene type of miRNA. Adjust this pattern based on how your data represents miRNA genes.

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run the query in your SQLite environment to get the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.

### Additional Considerations

- **Attribute Parsing**: If `attributes` are stored differently, adjust the LIKE clause accordingly.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure that the identifiers and formats used in the query match those in your database.

This approach should give you the number of miRNA genes present on chromosome 10. Adjust the query as needed based on the specific format of your data.
