To determine the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using your SQLite database, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Exons and Transcripts

First, ensure that your `features` table contains entries for exons and transcripts. Typically, in GFF/GTF files:
- **Exons** are annotated with the feature type "exon".
- **Transcripts** (or isoforms) might be annotated as "mRNA" or similar.

### Step 2: Extract Relevant Data

You need to extract exon data related to BRCA1 transcripts. This involves:
1. Identifying all transcript IDs associated with BRCA1.
2. Finding exons linked to these transcripts.

Assuming the `attributes` column in your `features` table contains information like `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, etc., you can use SQL queries to extract this data.

### Step 3: Write SQL Queries

#### Query 1: Find Transcript IDs for BRCA1

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'mRNA' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1";%';
```

This query retrieves all mRNA entries where the `attributes` column indicates they are associated with the gene ID "BRCA1".

#### Query 2: Extract Exon Sizes for BRCA1 Transcripts

Once you have the transcript IDs, use them to find exons:

```sql
SELECT f.id, f.start, f.end 
FROM features f
JOIN (
    SELECT attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'mRNA' 
    AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1";%'
) AS transcripts ON f.attributes LIKE CONCAT('%transcript_id "', REPLACE(transcripts.attributes, 'gene_id "BRCA1";', ''), '";%')
WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon';
```

This query joins the `features` table with itself to find exons linked to BRCA1 transcripts.

#### Query 3: Calculate Average Exon Size

Finally, calculate the average size of these exons:

```sql
SELECT AVG(end - start + 1) AS avg_exon_size 
FROM (
    SELECT f.start, f.end 
    FROM features f
    JOIN (
        SELECT attributes 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'mRNA' 
        AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1";%'
    ) AS transcripts ON f.attributes LIKE CONCAT('%transcript_id "', REPLACE(transcripts.attributes, 'gene_id "BRCA1";', ''), '";%')
    WHERE f.featuretype = 'exon'
);
```

### Explanation

- **Attributes Parsing**: The `attributes` column is parsed to extract gene and transcript IDs. This assumes a specific format (e.g., key-value pairs separated by semicolons).
- **JOIN Operation**: The subquery identifies transcripts associated with BRCA1, and the main query finds exons linked to these transcripts.
- **Average Calculation**: The average exon size is calculated by averaging the lengths of all identified exons.

### Note

Ensure your `attributes` column parsing logic matches the actual format in your database. Adjust the SQL queries if necessary to fit any variations in data structure or naming conventions.
