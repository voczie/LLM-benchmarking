To determine the biotype of specific genes (XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, RELB, and COL1A2) from a genome annotation stored in a SQLite3 database with the given schema, you'll need to query the `features` table. The biotype information is typically found within the `attributes` column of this table.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to construct your SQL query:

### Step 1: Understand the Attributes Column

The `attributes` column in GFF/GTF files usually contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons (`;`). For example, an entry might look like:
```
gene_id "XIST"; gene_name "XIST"; biotype "lncRNA";
```

### Step 2: Construct the SQL Query

You need to extract the `biotype` for each of your genes. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Select the relevant columns**: You want to select the `id`, `attributes`, and possibly other identifiers like `seqid` or `featuretype` if needed.
2. **Filter by gene name**: Use a condition to filter rows where the `attributes` column contains the specific gene names.
3. **Extract the biotype**: Use SQLite's string functions to parse the `biotype`.

Here is an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    attributes,
    SUBSTR(
        attributes,
        INSTR(attributes, 'biotype "') + 8,
        INSTR(attributes, '"', INSTR(attributes, 'biotype "') + 8) - INSTR(attributes, 'biotype "') - 8
    ) AS biotype
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%XIST%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%MALAT1%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%BRCA1%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%NFKB1%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%NFKB2%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%REL%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%RELA%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%RELB%"%' OR
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%COL1A2%"%';
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT Clause**: 
  - `id`: To identify the feature.
  - `attributes`: To access the full attribute string.
  - The `SUBSTR` and `INSTR` functions are used to extract the biotype from the attributes string.

- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Filters rows where the `attributes` column contains a specific gene name. Adjust the pattern as necessary if your data uses different naming conventions.

### Step 3: Execute the Query

Run this query in your SQLite3 environment. It will return the `id`, full `attributes`, and extracted `biotype` for each of the specified genes.

### Note:

- Ensure that the gene names are correctly matched with how they appear in your dataset.
- If the attribute format differs, you may need to adjust the string parsing logic accordingly.
- This query assumes that the biotype is always present. If it might be missing, consider adding error handling or default values.

This approach should help you retrieve the biotype information for the specified genes from your database.
