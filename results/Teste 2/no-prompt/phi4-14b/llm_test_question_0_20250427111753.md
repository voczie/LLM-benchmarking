To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform queries that filter by `seqid` (which represents the chromosome) and `featuretype`. Typically in GFF/GTF formats:

- Genes might be annotated with feature types like "gene".
- Transcripts might be annotated with feature types like "mRNA" or similar.

Here's a step-by-step guide to constructing your queries:

### Step 1: Count Genes on Chromosome 3

1. **Identify the Feature Type for Genes**: Confirm that genes are represented by the `featuretype` "gene". If your annotation uses a different term, adjust accordingly.
2. **Write the Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
   ```

### Step 2: Count Transcripts on Chromosome 3

1. **Identify the Feature Type for Transcripts**: Confirm that transcripts are represented by `featuretype` "mRNA". If your annotation uses a different term, adjust accordingly.
2. **Write the Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype = 'mRNA';
   ```

### Step 3: Execute the Queries

- Use an SQLite client or a programming language with SQLite support to execute these queries.
- Ensure your database connection is correctly set up and that you have access to the `features` table.

### Example Execution in Python (using sqlite3 module)

Here's how you might run these queries using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query for gene count on chromosome 3
gene_query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
"""
cursor.execute(gene_query)
gene_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome 3: {gene_count}")

# Query for transcript count on chromosome 3
transcript_query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '3' AND featuretype = 'mRNA';
"""
cursor.execute(transcript_query)
transcript_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: {transcript_count}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Notes

- Ensure that `seqid` values in your database match exactly with how chromosomes are labeled (e.g., '3' for chromosome 3).
- If your annotation uses different terms for genes or transcripts, adjust the `featuretype` conditions accordingly.
- The `relations` table might be useful if you need to explore hierarchical relationships between features, but it's not necessary for simple counts.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 in your dataset.
