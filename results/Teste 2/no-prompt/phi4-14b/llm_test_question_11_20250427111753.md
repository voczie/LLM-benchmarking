To determine the chromosomes where the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB are located using your SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema**: 
   - The `features` table contains genomic features with attributes such as `seqid` (chromosome), `featuretype`, and gene names stored in the `attributes` column.
   - We need to extract information from the `attributes` column, which typically includes key-value pairs like `gene_name="NFKB1"`.

2. **Query Construction**:
   - Use SQL to query the `features` table for entries where the `featuretype` is "gene" and the `attributes` contain any of the specified gene names.
   - Extract the chromosome (`seqid`) for each matching entry.

3. **SQL Query**:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
AND (
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name="NFKB1"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="NFKB2"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="REL"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="RELA"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="RELB"%'
);
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT DISTINCT seqid**: This selects unique chromosome identifiers where the genes are located.
  
- **FROM features**: We're querying from the `features` table.

- **WHERE featuretype = 'gene'**: Ensures we only look at entries that represent genes.

- **AND (...)**: Filters rows based on gene names within the `attributes` column using SQL's `LIKE` operator to match patterns. The `%` wildcard allows for matching any characters before or after the specified pattern.

### Execution:

1. Open your SQLite database in a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or use command-line tools.
2. Run the above query.
3. Review the results, which will list the chromosomes where each of the specified genes is located.

This approach assumes that gene names are stored in the `attributes` column in a consistent format. If your data uses a different format, you may need to adjust the pattern matching accordingly.
