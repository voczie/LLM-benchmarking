To generate a stacked bar plot representing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Query the Database

First, extract the necessary data from your SQLite database. You will need to count the number of each type of gene (protein-coding, lncRNA, miRNA) for each chromosome.

Assuming that the `attributes` column in the `features` table contains information about the gene type, you can use SQL queries to extract this data. Here's a general approach:

```sql
-- Query to count protein-coding genes per chromosome
SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS protein_coding_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "protein_coding"%'
GROUP BY seqid;

-- Query to count lncRNA genes per chromosome
SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "lincRNA"%'
GROUP BY seqid;

-- Query to count miRNA genes per chromosome
SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS mirna_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "miRNA"%'
GROUP BY seqid;
```

### Step 2: Combine the Results

You need to combine these results into a single dataset. You can do this by performing SQL joins:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.chromosome,
    COALESCE(p.protein_coding_count, 0) AS protein_coding_count,
    COALESCE(l.lncrna_count, 0) AS lncrna_count,
    COALESCE(m.mirna_count, 0) AS mirna_count
FROM 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' GROUP BY seqid) p
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS protein_coding_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "protein_coding"' GROUP BY seqid) pc ON p.chromosome = pc.chromosome
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "lincRNA"' GROUP BY seqid) l ON p.chromosome = l.chromosome
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS mirna_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "miRNA"' GROUP BY seqid) m ON p.chromosome = m.chromosome;
```

### Step 3: Export the Data

Export the combined results to a CSV file or directly into your Python environment using a library like `sqlite3` and `pandas`.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Execute the query and load the data into a DataFrame
query = """
SELECT 
    p.chromosome,
    COALESCE(p.protein_coding_count, 0) AS protein_coding_count,
    COALESCE(l.lncrna_count, 0) AS lncrna_count,
    COALESCE(m.mirna_count, 0) AS mirna_count
FROM 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' GROUP BY seqid) p
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS protein_coding_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "protein_coding"' GROUP BY seqid) pc ON p.chromosome = pc.chromosome
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "lincRNA"' GROUP BY seqid) l ON p.chromosome = l.chromosome
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT seqid AS chromosome, COUNT(*) AS mirna_count FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%biotype "miRNA"' GROUP BY seqid) m ON p.chromosome = m.chromosome;
"""

df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
conn.close()
```

### Step 4: Create the Stacked Bar Plot

Use a plotting library like `matplotlib` to create the stacked bar plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set up the figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Define the width of each bar
bar_width = 0.5

# Create the stacked bar plot
ax.bar(df['chromosome'], df['protein_coding_count'], label='Protein-coding', color='blue', width=bar_width)
ax.bar(df['chromosome'], df['lncrna_count'], bottom=df['protein_coding_count'], label='lncRNA', color='green', width=bar_width)
ax.bar(df['chromosome'], df['mirna_count'], bottom=df['protein_coding_count'] + df['lncrna_count'], label='miRNA', color='red', width=bar_width)

# Add labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('Chromosome')
ax.set_ylabel('Gene Count')
ax.set_title('Proportions of Gene Types by Chromosome')
ax.legend()

# Display the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This will generate a stacked bar plot showing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome. Adjust colors and labels as needed to fit your preferences or data specifics.
