To calculate the sizes of each specified gene locus (XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, COL1A2, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB) from a genome annotation stored in a SQLite3 database with the given schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema:**
   - The `features` table contains genomic features such as genes.
   - Each feature has attributes that include gene identifiers.

2. **Identify Gene Features:**
   - In GFF/GTF formats, gene features are typically labeled with `featuretype = 'gene'`.

3. **Extract Attributes:**
   - The `attributes` column in the `features` table contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons and spaces.
   - You need to extract the gene name from these attributes.

4. **Write SQL Queries:**

   Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can write an SQL query to calculate the sizes:

   ```sql
   -- Step 1: Extract gene names and their corresponding start and end positions
   SELECT 
       f.id,
       f.start,
       f.end,
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 10) AS gene_name
   FROM 
       features f
   WHERE 
       f.featuretype = 'gene'
       AND f.attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%';

   -- Step 2: Filter for specific genes and calculate their sizes
   SELECT 
       gene_name,
       MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1 AS size
   FROM (
       SELECT 
           f.id,
           f.start,
           f.end,
           SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 10, 
               INSTR(SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 10), '"') - 1) AS gene_name
       FROM 
           features f
       WHERE 
           f.featuretype = 'gene'
           AND f.attributes LIKE '%gene_name "%'
   )
   WHERE 
       gene_name IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'COL1A2', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB')
   GROUP BY 
       gene_name;
   ```

### Explanation:

- **Step 1:** This query extracts the `id`, `start`, and `end` positions of each feature where the `featuretype` is `'gene'`. It also extracts the `gene_name` from the `attributes` column using string functions.
  
- **Step 2:** The subquery filters for specific gene names. The main query calculates the size of each gene locus by finding the difference between the maximum `end` and minimum `start` positions, adding 1 to account for inclusive counting.

### Notes:

- Ensure that the attribute key is correctly identified as `'gene_name'`. It might vary slightly depending on the GFF/GTF dialect.
- The query assumes that each gene locus has a single contiguous region. If genes are split into multiple exons or parts, additional logic would be needed to sum these regions.

This approach should give you the sizes of the specified gene loci from your database. Adjust the attribute extraction logic if your GFF/GTF format uses different keys or formats for gene names.
