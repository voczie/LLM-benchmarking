To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes in the X chromosome using data from your SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Extract Gene Sizes

First, we need to extract the relevant information about genes on the X chromosome. Assuming that "gene" is one of the `featuretype` values in your `features` table, you can calculate gene sizes by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position for each gene.

Here's a SQL query to retrieve this data:

```sql
SELECT id, (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

This query selects genes on the X chromosome (`seqid = 'X'`) and calculates their sizes.

### Step 2: Export Data

You can export this data to a CSV file using SQLite's command-line interface or any database management tool that supports exporting results. Here’s how you might do it from the command line:

```bash
sqlite3 your_database.db "SELECT id, (end - start + 1) AS size FROM features WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene';" > gene_sizes.csv
```

### Step 3: Generate Scatterplot

Now that you have the data in a CSV file, you can use a programming language like Python with libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to generate the scatterplot.

Here’s an example using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data from the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('gene_sizes.csv')

# Create a scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['id'], data['size'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on X Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Gene ID')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to prevent clipping

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

- **Data Loading**: The `pandas` library is used to load data from the CSV file.
- **Scatter Plot**: `matplotlib.pyplot.scatter()` creates a scatterplot with gene IDs on the x-axis and their sizes on the y-axis.
- **Customization**: Titles, labels, and layout adjustments are added for clarity.

### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure that your database contains the necessary data and that the `seqid` column correctly identifies chromosomes.
- If you have a large number of genes, consider using a different visualization technique (e.g., histogram) to better represent the distribution.
- Adjust plot aesthetics as needed for presentation or publication.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome.
