To determine how many protein-coding genes are located on chromosome 12 using your SQLite database, you need to perform a SQL query that filters and counts entries in the `features` table. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Schema

- **features Table**: This table contains information about genomic features such as genes.
  - Relevant columns for this task:
    - `seqid`: Represents the chromosome or sequence identifier (e.g., "12" for chromosome 12).
    - `featuretype`: Describes the type of feature (e.g., "gene", "mRNA").
    - `attributes`: Contains additional information, often in a key-value format.

### Step 2: Identify Protein-Coding Genes

Protein-coding genes are typically represented by features like "gene" with specific attributes indicating they code for proteins. In GFF/GTF formats, this is often indicated by an attribute such as `gene_type="protein_coding"` or similar.

### Step 3: Construct the SQL Query

You need to:
1. Filter entries where `seqid` is "12".
2. Identify entries with `featuretype` of "gene" and check if they are protein-coding using the `attributes` column.
3. Count these entries.

Here's a sample query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS protein_coding_genes_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '12'
  AND featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type="protein_coding"%';
```

### Explanation of the Query

- `seqid = '12'`: Filters entries to only include those on chromosome 12.
- `featuretype = 'gene'`: Ensures we are looking at gene features.
- `attributes LIKE '%gene_type="protein_coding"%';`: Checks if the `attributes` column contains a key-value pair indicating the gene is protein-coding. Adjust this pattern if your data uses a different attribute name or format.

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run this query in your SQLite environment to get the count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

### Additional Considerations

- **Attribute Format**: Ensure that the `attributes` column is parsed correctly. If it's stored as a single string, you might need to adjust the pattern matching.
- **Data Consistency**: Verify that all relevant entries are consistently formatted in your database.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using your SQLite database.
