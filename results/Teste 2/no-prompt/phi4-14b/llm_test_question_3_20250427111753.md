To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema**: 
   - The `features` table contains genomic features with attributes such as `seqid` (chromosome identifier), `featuretype`, and other details.
   - You are interested in entries where `featuretype` is "pseudogene" and `seqid` corresponds to the X chromosome.

2. **Formulate the SQL Query**:
   - You need to count the number of rows in the `features` table that match these criteria.

3. **Write the SQL Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene'
     AND seqid = 'X';
   ```

### Explanation

- **SELECT COUNT(*)**: This part of the query counts all rows that match the specified conditions.
- **FROM features**: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.
- **WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene'**: Filters the results to include only those entries where the `featuretype` is "pseudogene".
- **AND seqid = 'X'**: Further filters the results to include only those entries located on the X chromosome.

### Execution

1. Open your SQLite database using a tool like SQLite Browser, or connect via a command-line interface.
2. Execute the query provided above.
3. The result will give you the count of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

This approach ensures that you accurately retrieve and count only those entries that meet both criteria: being a pseudogene and located on the X chromosome.
