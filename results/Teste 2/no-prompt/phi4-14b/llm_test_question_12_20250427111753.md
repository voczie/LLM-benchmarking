To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions of the gene `COL1A2` in your genome annotation database and then find the genes that are immediately before and after it. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this using SQL queries:

### Step 1: Identify the Position of COL1A2

First, we need to determine the start position of `COL1A2` in the genome. We'll assume that the gene name is stored within the `attributes` column in a format like `gene_name="COL1A2"`.

```sql
SELECT id, seqid, start, end
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%';
```

This query will return the ID and genomic coordinates of `COL1A2`.

### Step 2: Find Genes Immediately Before COL1A2

To find the gene immediately before `COL1A2`, we need to look for genes on the same chromosome (`seqid`) with an end position just before the start position of `COL1A2`.

```sql
WITH col1a2_position AS (
    SELECT id, seqid, start
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
)
SELECT f.id, f.attributes
FROM features f
JOIN col1a2_position c ON f.seqid = c.seqid
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.end < (SELECT start FROM col1a2_position)
ORDER BY f.end DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query finds the gene with the largest end position that is still less than the start of `COL1A2`.

### Step 3: Find Genes Immediately After COL1A2

Similarly, to find the gene immediately after `COL1A2`, we look for genes on the same chromosome with a start position just after the end position of `COL1A2`.

```sql
WITH col1a2_position AS (
    SELECT id, seqid, end
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
)
SELECT f.id, f.attributes
FROM features f
JOIN col1a2_position c ON f.seqid = c.seqid
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.start > (SELECT end FROM col1a2_position)
ORDER BY f.start ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query finds the gene with the smallest start position that is greater than the end of `COL1A2`.

### Step 4: Extract Gene Names

Finally, to extract the gene names from the `attributes` column, you can use a string manipulation function. Assuming your SQL dialect supports it (like SQLite's `REGEXP` or similar), you might do something like:

```sql
-- For the gene before COL1A2
SELECT 
    f.id,
    REGEXP(f.attributes, 'gene_name="([^"]+)"') AS gene_name
FROM features f
JOIN (
    SELECT id, seqid, start
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
) c ON f.seqid = c.seqid
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.end < (SELECT start FROM col1a2_position)
ORDER BY f.end DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- For the gene after COL1A2
SELECT 
    f.id,
    REGEXP(f.attributes, 'gene_name="([^"]+)"') AS gene_name
FROM features f
JOIN (
    SELECT id, seqid, end
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
) c ON f.seqid = c.seqid
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.start > (SELECT end FROM col1a2_position)
ORDER BY f.start ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

Note: The `REGEXP` function is used here as a placeholder. You may need to adjust this based on the specific SQL dialect and functions available in your environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the names of the genes located immediately before and after `COL1A2`.
