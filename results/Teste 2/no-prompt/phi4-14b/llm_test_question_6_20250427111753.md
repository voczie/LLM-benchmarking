To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has, along with their names and sizes, you can follow these steps using SQL queries on your SQLite database. Here's a walkthrough:

### Step 1: Identify the XIST Gene

First, we need to identify the ID of the XIST gene from the `features` table. The XIST gene is typically annotated as a "gene" feature type.

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "XIST"%';
```

This query assumes that the chromosome for the XIST gene is 'X'. Adjust `seqid` if necessary based on your data. The `attributes` column contains key-value pairs, and we're looking for an entry with `gene_id "XIST"`.

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms

Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, use it to find all related transcript isoforms. Transcripts are typically annotated as "transcript" feature types and are related to genes through the `relations` table.

Assuming the gene ID is stored in a variable called `xist_gene_id`, run:

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND level = 1;
```

This query retrieves all transcript IDs that are directly related to the XIST gene. The `level = 1` condition ensures we're looking at direct children (transcripts) of the gene.

### Step 3: Retrieve Transcript Names and Sizes

Now, for each transcript ID obtained in the previous step, retrieve their names and sizes from the `features` table. The transcript name is typically stored in the `attributes` column with a key like `transcript_id`.

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes,
    (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT child 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND level = 1
);
```

### Step 4: Extract Transcript Names

To extract the transcript names from the `attributes` column, you can use SQLite's string functions. Hereâ€™s how you might do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(attributes, instr(attributes, 'transcript_id "') + length('transcript_id "'), 
           instr(substr(attributes, instr(attributes, 'transcript_id "') + length('transcript_id "')), '"') - 1) AS transcript_name,
    (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT child 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id' AND level = 1
);
```

This query extracts the `transcript_id` from the `attributes` column and calculates the size of each transcript.

### Summary

By following these steps, you will obtain a list of all transcript isoforms for the XIST gene along with their names and sizes. Adjust the queries as necessary based on your specific database schema or data format nuances.
