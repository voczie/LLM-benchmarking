To generate a stacked bar plot representing the proportions of different types of genes (protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA) on each chromosome from your SQLite database, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract relevant data**: Query the `features` table to get counts of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes for each chromosome.
2. **Aggregate Data**: Summarize the counts per chromosome.
3. **Export Data**: Export the summarized data in a format suitable for plotting (e.g., CSV).
4. **Plotting**: Use a plotting library like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create the stacked bar plot.

Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Extract Relevant Data

First, let's write a SQL query that extracts counts of each gene type per chromosome:

```sql
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    featuretype,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
GROUP BY 
    seqid, featuretype;
```

This query will give you a table with columns `chromosome`, `featuretype`, and the corresponding counts.

### Step 2: Aggregate Data

You can use Python to aggregate this data into a format suitable for plotting. Here's an example using pandas:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Query the database and load results into a DataFrame
query = """
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    featuretype,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
GROUP BY 
    seqid, featuretype;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# Pivot table to get counts per chromosome and gene type
pivot_df = df.pivot_table(index='chromosome', columns='featuretype', values='count', aggfunc=sum).fillna(0)
```

### Step 3: Export Data (Optional)

If you want, you can export the DataFrame as a CSV file:

```python
pivot_df.to_csv('gene_counts_per_chromosome.csv')
```

### Step 4: Plotting

Now that we have our data in a suitable format, let's create a stacked bar plot using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

```python
# Set up the figure and axes
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create the stacked bar plot
ax = pivot_df.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, color=['blue', 'green', 'red'])

# Add labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('Chromosome')
ax.set_ylabel('Gene Count')
ax.set_title('Proportions of Protein-Coding, lncRNA, and miRNA Genes per Chromosome')

# Show the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation

- **SQL Query**: The SQL query extracts counts of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes for each chromosome.
- **Pandas Pivot Table**: This reshapes the data to have chromosomes as rows and gene types as columns with their respective counts.
- **Plotting**: `seaborn` is used here because it provides a convenient interface for creating stacked bar plots. The plot will show the distribution of different gene types across each chromosome.

This approach should give you a clear visual representation of how protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes are distributed across chromosomes in your genome annotation database.
