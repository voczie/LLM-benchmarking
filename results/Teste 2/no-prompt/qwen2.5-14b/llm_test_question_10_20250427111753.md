To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene in your SQLite database, you need to retrieve information from the `features` table. The attributes column typically contains additional details about each feature, including gene names or IDs.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to query this information:

### Step 1: Identify the Gene ID
First, we need to find out if there is an entry for BRCA1 in the `attributes` field of the `features` table. The attributes column usually contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons (`;`). For example, a gene might have an attribute like `gene_id "BRCA1"` or `Name "BRCA1"`. 

### Step 2: Query the Database
We will write a SQL query to extract the chromosomal position (i.e., `seqid`, `start`, and `end`) of the BRCA1 gene.

Here is an example query:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%'
   OR attributes LIKE '%Name "BRCA1"%';
```

This query looks for entries in the `features` table where the `attributes` field contains either `"gene_id BRCA1"` or `"Name BRCA1"`. Adjust the pattern if your database uses a different format.

### Step 3: Execute and Interpret the Query
Run this SQL command against your SQLite database. The result will give you the chromosome (`seqid`) and the start and end positions of the BRCA1 gene.

If there are multiple entries (e.g., for different transcripts or exons), you might need to refine your query further based on the specific structure of your data.

### Example Output
The output could look something like this:

```
| seqid | start  | end    |
|-------|--------|--------|
| chr17 | 4304495| 4312560|
```

This means that the BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17, starting at position 4,304,495 and ending at position 4,312,560.

### Additional Considerations
- **Gene ID vs. Transcript ID**: If your database uses transcript IDs instead of gene names in the attributes field, you might need to look up the BRCA1 gene's associated transcripts first.
- **Multiple Entries**: There could be multiple entries for a single gene (e.g., different transcripts or exons). You may want to filter by `featuretype` if necessary.

### Example with Feature Type
If you specifically want to find the chromosomal position of the gene itself, not its transcripts:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND (attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%'
       OR attributes LIKE '%Name "BRCA1"%');
```

This query ensures that you are looking at the gene-level entry for BRCA1.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to retrieve the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene from your SQLite database. Adjust the SQL queries as necessary based on the specific structure and content of your data.
