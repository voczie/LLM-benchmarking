To determine how many exons the XIST gene has, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the ID of the XIST gene**: First, find the `id` of the feature corresponding to the XIST gene in the `features` table.
2. **Find all exons related to the XIST gene**: Use the `relations` table to find all exons that are children of the XIST gene.

Here's a step-by-step guide and SQL queries to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the ID of the XIST Gene

First, you need to query the `features` table to get the `id` of the feature corresponding to the XIST gene. The attributes column in GFF/GTF files typically contains information about the gene name or other identifiers.

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%';
```

This query will return the ID(s) of the XIST gene. If there are multiple IDs, you need to ensure that you're selecting the correct one based on additional criteria if necessary (e.g., checking for specific source or other attribute details).

### Step 2: Find All Exons Related to the XIST Gene

Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, use this ID in a query against the `relations` table to find all exons that are children of the XIST gene.

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_ID' AND level = 1;
```

Replace `'XIST_ID'` with the actual ID you found from Step 1. The `level = 1` condition ensures that we're looking for direct children (exons) of the gene.

### Step 3: Count the Number of Exons

Finally, count how many exons are returned by the previous query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(child) 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_ID' AND level = 1;
```

Replace `'XIST_ID'` with the actual ID you found from Step 1.

### Putting It All Together

Here's a complete example assuming that the XIST gene has an `id` of `'gene:XIST'`.

```sql
-- Find the ID of the XIST gene
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

-- Use this ID to find all exons related to the XIST gene
WITH xist_id AS (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%'
)
SELECT child 
FROM relations, xist_id 
WHERE parent = xist_id.id AND level = 1;

-- Count the number of exons
WITH xist_id AS (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%'
)
SELECT COUNT(child) 
FROM relations, xist_id 
WHERE parent = xist_id.id AND level = 1;
```

This will give you the count of exons associated with the XIST gene.

### Notes:
- Ensure that your `attributes` column is properly formatted and contains the necessary information to uniquely identify genes.
- If there are multiple IDs for the same gene (e.g., due to different sources or versions), make sure to handle them appropriately in your queries.
