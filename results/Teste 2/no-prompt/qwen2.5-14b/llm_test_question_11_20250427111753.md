To find out on which chromosomes the genes `NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, and `RELB` are located using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Gene IDs in the Database

First, we need to identify if the gene names (`NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, `RELB`) are stored directly as attributes or if they have corresponding IDs. Typically, genes will be annotated with an attribute like `gene_id` that corresponds to a unique identifier for each gene.

### Step 2: Query the Database

Assuming the genes are referenced by their names in the `attributes` column (or possibly another column depending on how your data is structured), you can write a query to extract this information. Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT seqid, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%NFKB1%' OR attributes LIKE '%NFKB2%' OR attributes LIKE '%REL%' OR attributes LIKE '%RELA%' OR attributes LIKE '%RELB%';
```

However, if the gene names are stored in a more structured way (e.g., `gene_id`), you might need to look for those specific IDs. For example:

```sql
SELECT seqid 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB1"%';
```

You would then repeat this query for each gene name.

### Step 3: Extract Gene Information

If the genes are referenced by `gene_id`, you might need to extract the actual IDs first and then use them in your main query. Here's an example of how you could do that:

```sql
-- Get gene_ids for NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, REBL
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB1"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB2"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "REL"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELA"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELB"%';
```

### Step 4: Final Query

Once you have the gene IDs, you can use them in your final query to get the chromosomes:

```sql
-- Assuming we got gene_ids from previous step as a list of ids (e.g., 'gene1', 'gene2')
SELECT seqid 
FROM features 
WHERE id IN ('gene1', 'gene2');  -- Replace with actual IDs obtained from Step 3
```

### Example Query

If you have the exact `gene_id` values, your final query might look like this:

```sql
-- Assuming gene_ids are known and stored in a variable or subquery
SELECT seqid 
FROM features 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB1"%',
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB2"%',
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "REL"%',
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELA"%',
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELB"%'
);
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `attributes` column contains the gene names or IDs in a consistent format.
- Adjust the query based on how your data is structured and stored.

This should give you the chromosomes where these genes are located.
