To find out how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome in your SQLite database, you can use SQL queries. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: You need to look at the `features` table where the `seqid`, `featuretype`, and other necessary information is stored.

2. **Filter by feature type**: You want to filter for pseudogenes, which are typically represented as a specific value in the `featuretype` column (e.g., "pseudogene").

3. **Filter by chromosome**: You need to ensure that only features on the X chromosome are considered, so you'll look at entries where `seqid` is 'X'.

4. **Count the filtered results**: Use SQL's COUNT function to count how many rows match these criteria.

Hereâ€™s a query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene';
```

### Explanation:
- `seqid = 'X'`: This condition filters the results to only include entries where the chromosome is X.
- `featuretype = 'pseudogene'`: This condition ensures that we are counting only pseudogenes.
- `COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count`: This counts all rows matching the criteria and labels the result as `pseudogene_count`.

### Steps to Execute:
1. **Connect to your SQLite database**: Use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, or connect via Python with libraries such as sqlite3.

2. **Run the query**:
   - Copy and paste the above SQL statement into your SQLite interface.
   - Press "Execute" or run it in your script if you're using an API.

This will return the number of pseudogenes located on the X chromosome.

### Example Output:
If there are 123 pseudogenes on the X chromosome, the query result would look like this:

```
pseudogene_count
-----------------
123
```

That's it! You now have a count of how many pseudogenes are present on the X chromosome in your genome annotation database.
