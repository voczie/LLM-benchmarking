To calculate the sizes of each gene locus for the genes `XIST`, `MALAT1`, `BRCA1`, `COL1A2`, `NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, and `RELB` from a GFF/GTF formatted genome annotation stored in an SQLite3 database, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Gene IDs
First, we need to identify the gene IDs for each of the genes listed. This information is typically contained within the `attributes` column where gene names are specified.

### Step 2: Extract Gene Sizes
Once we have identified the gene IDs, we can calculate the size (length) of each gene locus by querying the start and end positions from the `features` table.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes AS gene_name,
    MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1 AS gene_size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND
    attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:%'
GROUP BY 
    gene_name;
```

However, the above query assumes that `attributes` contains a field like `ID=gene:XIST`. If your database uses a different format for storing gene names (e.g., `Name=XIST`), you will need to adjust the `LIKE` clause accordingly.

### Step 3: Filter Specific Genes
To filter only the specific genes of interest (`XIST`, `MALAT1`, `BRCA1`, `COL1A2`, `NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, and `RELB`), you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes AS gene_name,
    MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1 AS gene_size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND
    (attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:XIST%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:MALAT1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:BRCA1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:COL1A2%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:NFKB1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:NFKB2%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:REL%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:RELA%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:RELB%')
GROUP BY 
    gene_name;
```

### Step 4: Adjust for Different Attribute Formats
If your `attributes` column uses a different format, you might need to adjust the query. For example, if it uses `Name=XIST`, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes AS gene_name,
    MAX(end) - MIN(start) + 1 AS gene_size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND
    (attributes LIKE '%Name=XIST%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=MALAT1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=BRCA1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=NFKB1%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=NFKB2%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=REL%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=RELA%' OR
     attributes LIKE '%Name=RELB%')
GROUP BY 
    gene_name;
```

### Step 5: Execute the Query
Run the query in your SQLite3 database to get the sizes of each specified gene locus.

This approach assumes that the `features` table contains all necessary information and that the genes are annotated as 'gene' features. If there is a different structure or if additional filtering is required, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.
