To answer the question "How many exons does each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene have?", you need to query your SQLite database in a way that links transcripts with their corresponding exons. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. Identify Transcript and Exon Features
First, identify which features are transcripts and which are exons based on the `featuretype` column.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT featuretype FROM features WHERE featuretype IN ('transcript', 'exon');
```

This will confirm that you have both transcript and exon entries in your database.

#### 2. Find BRCA1 Transcripts
Next, find all transcripts of the BRCA1 gene by filtering on `attributes` where `gene_name` is "BRCA1". The attributes column typically contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons, so you'll need to extract the relevant information using SQL functions.

```sql
SELECT id AS transcript_id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="BRCA1"%';
```

#### 3. Count Exons for Each Transcript
Now that you have identified all BRCA1 transcripts, count the number of exons associated with each transcript using the `relations` table.

```sql
SELECT 
    t.transcript_id,
    COUNT(e.exon_id) AS exon_count
FROM (
    SELECT id AS transcript_id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="BRCA1"%'
) t
JOIN relations r ON t.transcript_id = r.parent
JOIN features e ON r.child = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY t.transcript_id;
```

#### 4. Extract Transcript Names
To get the transcript names, you need to extract them from the `attributes` column of the transcripts.

```sql
SELECT 
    SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="'), INSTR(attributes, '"', INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="')) - (INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="'))) AS transcript_name,
    COUNT(e.exon_id) AS exon_count
FROM (
    SELECT id AS transcript_id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="BRCA1"%'
) t
JOIN relations r ON t.transcript_id = r.parent
JOIN features e ON r.child = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY t.transcript_id;
```

#### 5. Final Query Combining All Steps
Combine all the steps into a single query to get the transcript names and exon counts.

```sql
SELECT 
    SUBSTR(t.attributes, INSTR(t.attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="'), INSTR(t.attributes, '"', INSTR(t.attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="')) - (INSTR(t.attributes, 'transcript_name="') + LENGTH('transcript_name="'))) AS transcript_name,
    COUNT(e.exon_id) AS exon_count
FROM (
    SELECT id AS transcript_id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="BRCA1"%'
) t
JOIN relations r ON t.transcript_id = r.parent
JOIN features e ON r.child = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY t.transcript_id;
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 2**: Filters transcripts of the BRCA1 gene.
- **Step 3**: Joins `relations` to link each transcript with its exons and counts them.
- **Step 4 & Step 5**: Extracts the `transcript_name` from the attributes column for better readability.

This query will give you a list of all BRCA1 transcripts along with the number of exons they contain.
