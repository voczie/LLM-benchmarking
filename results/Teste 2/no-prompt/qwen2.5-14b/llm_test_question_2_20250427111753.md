To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are located on chromosome 7, you can use SQL queries to extract and count relevant entries from your SQLite database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the relevant table**: The `features` table contains information about genomic features such as lncRNAs.

2. **Filter by feature type**: You need to filter for features that are specifically annotated as lncRNA genes.

3. **Filter by chromosome**: You will also want to restrict your query to entries on chromosome 7 (assuming the sequence identifier is `chr7` or simply `7`, depending on how it's stored in your database).

4. **Count the filtered results**: Finally, you need to count these filtered records.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'lncRNA' AND seqid = '7';
```

### Explanation:
- `COUNT(*)`: This function counts the number of rows returned by the query.
- `featuretype = 'lncRNA'`: Filters for entries where the type is specifically lncRNA.
- `seqid = '7'`: Restricts to chromosome 7. If your database uses a different format (e.g., `chr7`), you should adjust this accordingly.

### Steps to Execute:
1. **Connect to the SQLite Database**: Use a tool like `sqlite3`, Python with `sqlite3` module, or any other SQL client that supports SQLite.
2. **Run the Query**: Copy and paste the above query into your SQL execution environment.
3. **Interpret Results**: The result will be a single number representing how many lncRNA genes are on chromosome 7.

### Example in Python:
If you prefer to run this using Python, here’s an example:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'lncRNA' AND seqid = '7';
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.

This query will give you the count of lncRNA genes specifically located on chromosome 7 in your genome annotation database.
