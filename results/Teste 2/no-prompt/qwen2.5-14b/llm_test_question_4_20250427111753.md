To determine how many genes for miRNA exist in chromosome 10, you need to query your SQLite database using SQL. The `features` table contains information about genomic features such as genes and their attributes. You will want to filter the rows where:

- The `seqid` column is 'chr10' (assuming that chromosome 10 is represented as 'chr10').
- The `featuretype` column is 'gene'.
- The `attributes` column contains information about miRNA.

The `attributes` column typically stores additional attributes of the feature in a key-value format. For example, it might contain something like "gene_type=miRNA" or similar to indicate that the gene is an miRNA gene.

Here's how you can write a query to find out how many genes for miRNA exist on chromosome 10:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr10'
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type=miRNA%';
```

### Explanation:
- `seqid = 'chr10'`: Filters the rows to only include those on chromosome 10.
- `featuretype = 'gene'`: Ensures that we are looking at genes specifically.
- `attributes LIKE '%gene_type=miRNA%'`: This condition checks if the attributes column contains a substring indicating that the gene is an miRNA. The exact format might vary depending on how your GFF/GTF file was parsed, so you may need to adjust this part of the query based on the actual content of the `attributes` field.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the attribute key-value pair for miRNA genes in your database matches exactly what is specified in the query. If it's different (e.g., "gene_biotype=miRNA"), you'll need to adjust the LIKE condition accordingly.
- The `LIKE` operator can be slow on large datasets because it doesn't use indexes effectively. If performance becomes an issue, consider normalizing your data or using a full-text search index if SQLite supports it.

### Example Query with Potential Attribute Variations:
If the attribute format is different and you're unsure of its exact structure, you might want to inspect some sample rows first:

```sql
SELECT attributes FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

This will help you determine the correct pattern to use in your `LIKE` condition.

### Final Query with Assumed Attribute Format:
If after inspection, you find that miRNA genes are indeed marked as "gene_type=miRNA", then the initial query is appropriate. If it's something else like "biotype=miRNA" or similar, adjust accordingly:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr10'
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%biotype=miRNA%';
```

This should give you the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.
