To find out how many protein-coding genes are on chromosome 12, you can use SQL queries to filter and count the relevant entries in your SQLite database. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Columns
You need to identify which columns contain information about the gene type and chromosome.

- The `featuretype` column contains the feature types (e.g., "gene", "mRNA", etc.)
- The `seqid` column contains the chromosome or scaffold names (e.g., "chr12")

### Step 2: Filter for Protein-Coding Genes
Protein-coding genes are typically annotated as `featuretype = 'protein_coding'`. However, in GFF/GTF files, protein-coding genes might be represented by their mRNA features which have the attribute `gene_biotype` set to "protein_coding". You need to check if your database stores this information directly or through attributes.

### Step 3: Filter for Chromosome 12
You will filter entries where `seqid = 'chr12'`.

### Step 4: Count the Entries
Finally, you count how many such features exist in the table.

Here's a SQL query that should work assuming your database stores protein-coding information directly as feature types:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_protein_coding_genes 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'protein_coding';
```

If instead, you have to check attributes for the gene biotype, you would need to parse the `attributes` column. The format of this column is typically key-value pairs separated by semicolons and spaces (e.g., "gene_biotype protein_coding"). You can use SQL functions like `LIKE`, `SUBSTR`, or regular expressions to extract these values.

Here's an example query assuming you need to check the attributes for gene biotypes:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_protein_coding_genes 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype protein_coding%';
```

### Step 5: Execute and Interpret Results
Run this query in your SQLite database. The result will give you the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

If your `attributes` column uses a different format or if there are multiple ways to specify gene biotypes, you might need to adjust the query accordingly. For example, if attributes are stored as JSON-like strings, you would use functions like `json_extract`.

### Additional Considerations
- Ensure that your database schema and data structure match what is expected by these queries.
- If necessary, normalize or preprocess your data to make querying easier.

This should give you a good starting point for finding the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 in your SQLite database.
