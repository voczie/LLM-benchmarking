To determine the strands of the genes HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 from your SQLite database, you can use a SQL query to extract this information directly from the `features` table. The `attributes` column in the `features` table likely contains gene-specific attributes such as ID or Name that we can filter on.

Here's how you could write a query to find out which strand each of these genes is located on:

```sql
SELECT id, seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%ID=HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%Name=HOTAIR%'
   OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%Name=HOXC11%'
   OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%' OR attributes LIKE '%Name=HOXC12%';
```

This query searches for the genes by their ID or Name in the `attributes` column and returns the strand information along with other relevant details.

### Explanation:
- **LIKE '%ID=HOTAIR%'**: This condition checks if the `attributes` field contains "ID=HOTAIR". Similarly, it does the same for HOXC11 and HOXC12.
- **OR attributes LIKE '%Name=...%':** Some GFF/GTF files use Name instead of ID to identify genes. So we include both possibilities.

### Steps:
1. Connect to your SQLite database using a tool like `sqlite3` command-line utility or any programming language that supports SQLite (e.g., Python, R).
2. Execute the above SQL query.
3. Review the output which will show you the strand information for each gene of interest.

If the attributes are stored in a different format or if there's another column dedicated to storing gene names or IDs separately from `attributes`, adjust the query accordingly based on your database schema and data structure.
