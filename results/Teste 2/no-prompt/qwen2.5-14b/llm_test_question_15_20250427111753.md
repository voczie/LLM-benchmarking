To find which genes are located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both the positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12

First, we need to retrieve the start and end coordinates for `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`. We will assume that both genes are on the same chromosome (`seqid`). If they are not, you would need additional logic to handle different chromosomes.

```sql
SELECT 
    seqid,
    strand,
    MIN(start) AS min_start,
    MAX(end) AS max_end
FROM features
WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
GROUP BY seqid, strand;
```

This query will give you the start and end positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` for each strand on their respective chromosomes.

### Step 2: Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12

Once we have the coordinates, we can use them to find other genes that lie within this range. We will need to run separate queries for the positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands since the logic differs based on the strand direction.

#### For the Positive Strand (+):

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT 
        seqid,
        MIN(start) AS min_start,
        MAX(end) AS max_end
    FROM features
    WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
)
SELECT f.*
FROM features f
JOIN hoxc_positions h ON f.seqid = h.seqid AND f.strand = '+'
WHERE 
    f.featuretype = 'gene' AND
    f.start > h.min_start AND
    f.end < h.max_end;
```

#### For the Negative Strand (-):

For the negative strand, we need to reverse the logic because genes are read from right to left.

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT 
        seqid,
        MIN(start) AS min_start,
        MAX(end) AS max_end
    FROM features
    WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
)
SELECT f.*
FROM features f
JOIN hoxc_positions h ON f.seqid = h.seqid AND f.strand = '-'
WHERE 
    f.featuretype = 'gene' AND
    f.start < h.max_end AND
    f.end > h.min_start;
```

### Step 3: Combine Results

Finally, you can combine the results from both queries to get a complete list of genes between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands.

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT 
        seqid,
        MIN(start) AS min_start,
        MAX(end) AS max_end
    FROM features
    WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
),
positive_genes AS (
    SELECT f.*
    FROM features f
    JOIN hoxc_positions h ON f.seqid = h.seqid AND f.strand = '+'
    WHERE 
        f.featuretype = 'gene' AND
        f.start > h.min_start AND
        f.end < h.max_end
),
negative_genes AS (
    SELECT f.*
    FROM features f
    JOIN hoxc_positions h ON f.seqid = h.seqid AND f.strand = '-'
    WHERE 
        f.featuretype = 'gene' AND
        f.start < h.max_end AND
        f.end > h.min_start
)
SELECT * FROM positive_genes UNION ALL SELECT * FROM negative_genes;
```

This final query will give you a list of genes located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both the positive and negative strands.
