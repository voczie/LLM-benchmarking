To find the average exon size for the BRCA1 transcript isoforms, you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the relevant transcripts and exons

First, identify all the transcripts that belong to the BRCA1 gene. Then, find their corresponding exons.

#### Query to get BRCA1 transcripts:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T.id AS transcript_id 
FROM features AS T
JOIN relations AS R ON T.id = R.parent
WHERE T.featuretype = 'transcript' AND R.child LIKE '%BRCA1';
```

This query will give you the IDs of all transcripts that are related to BRCA1.

#### Query to get exons for these transcripts:
```sql
SELECT E.id, E.start, E.end 
FROM features AS E
JOIN relations AS R ON E.id = R.parent AND R.level = 1 -- level 1 indicates direct children (exons)
WHERE R.child IN (
    SELECT T.id FROM features AS T JOIN relations AS R ON T.id = R.parent WHERE T.featuretype = 'transcript' AND R.child LIKE '%BRCA1'
);
```

This query will give you the IDs, start positions, and end positions of all exons that belong to BRCA1 transcripts.

### Step 2: Calculate exon sizes

Now calculate the size (length) of each exon:

```sql
SELECT E.id AS exon_id, E.start, E.end, (E.end - E.start + 1) AS exon_size 
FROM features AS E
JOIN relations AS R ON E.id = R.parent AND R.level = 1 -- level 1 indicates direct children (exons)
WHERE R.child IN (
    SELECT T.id FROM features AS T JOIN relations AS R ON T.id = R.parent WHERE T.featuretype = 'transcript' AND R.child LIKE '%BRCA1'
);
```

This query will give you the size of each exon.

### Step 3: Calculate average exon size

Finally, calculate the average size of these exons:

```sql
SELECT AVG(exon_size) AS avg_exon_size 
FROM (
    SELECT (E.end - E.start + 1) AS exon_size 
    FROM features AS E
    JOIN relations AS R ON E.id = R.parent AND R.level = 1 -- level 1 indicates direct children (exons)
    WHERE R.child IN (
        SELECT T.id FROM features AS T JOIN relations AS R ON T.id = R.parent WHERE T.featuretype = 'transcript' AND R.child LIKE '%BRCA1'
    )
);
```

This query will give you the average size of exons for BRCA1 transcript isoforms.

### Full Query

Combining all steps into a single query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(exon_size) AS avg_exon_size 
FROM (
    SELECT (E.end - E.start + 1) AS exon_size 
    FROM features AS E
    JOIN relations AS R ON E.id = R.parent AND R.level = 1 -- level 1 indicates direct children (exons)
    WHERE R.child IN (
        SELECT T.id FROM features AS T JOIN relations AS R ON T.id = R.parent WHERE T.featuretype = 'transcript' AND R.child LIKE '%BRCA1'
    )
);
```

This query will provide the average size of exons for BRCA1 transcript isoforms.
