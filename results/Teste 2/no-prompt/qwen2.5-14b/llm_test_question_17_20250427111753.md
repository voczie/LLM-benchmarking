To generate a scatter plot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Gene Sizes from SQLite Database**: First, extract the start and end positions for all genes located on the X chromosome.

2. **Calculate Gene Lengths**: Calculate the length (size) of each gene by subtracting the start position from the end position.

3. **Export Data to a Format Suitable for Plotting**: Export this data into a format that can be easily plotted, such as CSV or directly use Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

4. **Generate Scatterplot**: Use a plotting library (like matplotlib in Python) to create the scatter plot.

Here's how you could do it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Extract Gene Sizes from SQLite Database

First, connect to your SQLite database and extract gene sizes for genes located on the X chromosome. Assuming that `featuretype` is used to specify if a feature is a gene (e.g., "gene" or "mRNA"), you can write a query like this:

```sql
SELECT id, seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype IN ('gene', 'mRNA');
```

This SQL query selects the ID, sequence identifier (seqid), and start/end positions of all genes or mRNA on chromosome X.

### Step 2: Calculate Gene Lengths

You can calculate gene lengths directly in Python after fetching data from SQLite. Here's an example using Python:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Fetch gene sizes for chromosome X
query = """
SELECT id, seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype IN ('gene', 'mRNA');
"""
df_genes = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Calculate the length of each gene
df_genes['length'] = df_genes['end'] - df_genes['start']

# Close the connection to the database
conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Export Data (Optional)

If you want to export this data for further analysis or plotting in another tool, you can save it as a CSV file:

```python
df_genes.to_csv('gene_sizes_X_chromosome.csv', index=False)
```

### Step 4: Generate Scatterplot

Now that we have the gene lengths, let's create a scatter plot using `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

```python
# Plotting the distribution of gene sizes on X chromosome
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df_genes['length'], df_genes.index, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
plt.xlabel('Gene Length (bp)')
plt.ylabel('Index of Genes')
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This code will generate a scatter plot where each point represents a gene's length and its position in the DataFrame. The x-axis shows the gene lengths, and the y-axis can be used to show the index or any other relevant information.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have `pandas` and `matplotlib` installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib`).
- Adjust the SQL query if your database schema uses different column names for genes or chromosomes.
- The scatter plot might look crowded with many points. Consider using a histogram instead to better visualize the distribution of gene sizes.

This approach should give you a clear visual representation of how gene sizes are distributed across chromosome X in your genome annotation data.
