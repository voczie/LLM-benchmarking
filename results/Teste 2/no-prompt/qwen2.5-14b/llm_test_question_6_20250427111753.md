To answer the question "How many transcript isoforms does the XIST gene have?" and print the transcript isoform names along with their sizes, you need to query the `features` table for features that are associated with the XIST gene. Since GFF/GTF files typically use attributes like `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, etc., we'll assume that the `attributes` column in your SQLite database contains these details.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Identify Gene ID**: First, you need to find the gene ID for XIST.
2. **Find Transcript IDs**: Then, use the gene ID to find all transcript IDs associated with it.
3. **Calculate Sizes**: Finally, calculate the size of each transcript by subtracting its `start` from its `end`.

### Step 1: Identify Gene ID

First, you need to get the gene ID for XIST. This can be done by querying the features table where the feature type is 'gene' and the attributes contain information about the gene name.

```sql
SELECT id AS gene_id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%';
```

### Step 2: Find Transcript IDs

Once you have the gene ID, you can find all transcript IDs associated with this gene. This involves querying the `features` table for features of type 'transcript' and checking if they are related to the XIST gene through the `relations` table.

```sql
SELECT f.id AS transcript_id FROM features f JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child WHERE r.parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%') AND f.featuretype = 'transcript';
```

### Step 3: Calculate Sizes and Print Results

Now that you have the transcript IDs, you can calculate their sizes and print them along with their names.

```sql
WITH gene_id AS (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST"%'
),
transcripts AS (
    SELECT f.id AS transcript_id, f.attributes 
    FROM features f JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child 
    WHERE r.parent IN (SELECT id FROM gene_id) AND f.featuretype = 'transcript'
)
SELECT t.transcript_id,
       SUBSTR(t.attributes, INSTR(t.attributes, 'transcript_name "') + 16, INSTR(SUBSTR(t.attributes, INSTR(t.attributes, 'transcript_name "') + 16), '"') - 1) AS transcript_name,
       (f.end - f.start + 1) AS size
FROM transcripts t JOIN features f ON t.transcript_id = f.id;
```

### Explanation:

- **gene_id CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) selects the gene ID for XIST.
- **transcripts CTE**: This CTE finds all transcript IDs associated with the XIST gene by joining `features` and `relations`.
- **Final Query**: The final query joins the transcripts CTE back to the features table, extracts the `transcript_name` from the attributes column using string functions (assuming a specific format), calculates the size of each transcript, and prints both.

### Notes:
- Ensure that your SQLite database has proper indexing on columns like `featuretype`, `attributes`, `parent`, and `child` to optimize query performance.
- The exact parsing logic for extracting `transcript_name` from attributes might need adjustment based on the actual format used in your GFF/GTF file.

This approach should give you a list of transcript isoforms for XIST along with their sizes.
