To find the names of the two genes located immediately before and after the gene `COL1A2`, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the position of the `COL1A2` gene**: We will first locate the start and end positions of the `COL1A2` gene.
2. **Find genes on the same chromosome (seqid) but with different start/end positions**:
   - For the gene immediately before `COL1A2`, we need to find a gene that ends just before the start position of `COL1A2`.
   - For the gene immediately after `COL1A2`, we need to find a gene that starts just after the end position of `COL1A2`.

Here is how you can write SQL queries for these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Position of COL1A2 Gene
First, let's get the start and end positions of the `COL1A2` gene.

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%';
```

Let's assume this query returns a single row with values for `seqid`, `start`, and `end`.

### Step 2: Find the Gene Immediately Before COL1A2
To find the gene immediately before `COL1A2`, we need to look for genes on the same chromosome that end just before the start position of `COL1A2`:

```sql
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '<seqid>' AND strand = '+' AND end < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%') 
ORDER BY end DESC LIMIT 1;
```

For genes on the negative strand, we need to adjust the query:

```sql
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '<seqid>' AND strand = '-' AND start > (SELECT start FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%') 
ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Find the Gene Immediately After COL1A2
To find the gene immediately after `COL1A2`, we need to look for genes on the same chromosome that start just after the end position of `COL1A2`:

```sql
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '<seqid>' AND strand = '+' AND start > (SELECT end FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%') 
ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1;
```

For genes on the negative strand, we need to adjust the query:

```sql
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '<seqid>' AND strand = '-' AND end < (SELECT end FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%') 
ORDER BY end DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Putting It All Together
Let's combine these steps into a single query to get the names of both genes:

```sql
WITH col1a2_info AS (
    SELECT seqid, start as col1a2_start, end as col1a2_end 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name=COL1A2%'
),
before_col1a2 AS (
    SELECT id, attributes
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM col1a2_info) AND strand = '+' AND end < (SELECT col1a2_start FROM col1a2_info)
    ORDER BY end DESC LIMIT 1
),
after_col1a2 AS (
    SELECT id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM col1a2_info) AND strand = '+' AND start > (SELECT col1a2_end FROM col1a2_info)
    ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1
),
before_col1a2_neg AS (
    SELECT id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM col1a2_info) AND strand = '-' AND start > (SELECT col1a2_start FROM col1a2_info)
    ORDER BY start ASC LIMIT 1
),
after_col1a2_neg AS (
    SELECT id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM col1a2_info) AND strand = '-' AND end < (SELECT col1a2_end FROM col1a2_info)
    ORDER BY end DESC LIMIT 1
),
before_gene AS (
    SELECT id, attributes FROM before_col1a2 UNION ALL SELECT id, attributes FROM before_col1a2_neg
),
after_gene AS (
    SELECT id, attributes FROM after_col1a2 UNION ALL SELECT id, attributes FROM after_col1a2_neg
)
SELECT 
    (SELECT attributes FROM before_gene) as gene_before,
    (SELECT attributes FROM after_gene) as gene_after;
```

This query will return the names of the genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`. Note that you may need to adjust the logic if there are multiple genes with the same start/end positions or if the strand information is not correctly handled.
