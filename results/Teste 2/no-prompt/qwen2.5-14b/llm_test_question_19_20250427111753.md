To generate a boxplot representing the comparison of `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcript sizes from your SQLite database, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Transcript Sizes**: First, extract the sizes (length) of transcripts for each type (`protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, `miRNA`). This involves querying the `features` table where the featuretype is one of those transcript types.

2. **Aggregate Data by Type**: Aggregate the data to get the lengths of all transcripts per type and store them in a temporary or subquery result set.

3. **Generate Boxplot Data**: Use SQL to generate the necessary summary statistics (min, max, quartiles) for each transcript type which can be used directly in plotting software like Python's matplotlib/seaborn.

4. **Plotting with Python**: Finally, use Python and its libraries such as pandas and seaborn to plot a boxplot based on the data extracted from SQL.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Extract Transcript Sizes
First, you need to extract transcript sizes for each type of feature:

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes,
    end - start + 1 AS length
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA');
```

#### 2. Aggregate Data by Type
Next, you need to aggregate the data and extract the necessary statistics for each type:

```sql
WITH transcript_lengths AS (
    SELECT 
        attributes,
        end - start + 1 AS length
    FROM 
        features
    WHERE 
        featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%' THEN 'protein_coding'
        WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="lncRNA"%' THEN 'lncRNA'
        WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%' THEN 'miRNA'
    END AS transcript_type,
    length
FROM 
    transcript_lengths;
```

#### 3. Generate Boxplot Data
To generate the boxplot data, you can use SQL to calculate min, max, quartiles, and median for each type:

```sql
WITH transcript_lengths AS (
    SELECT 
        attributes,
        end - start + 1 AS length
    FROM 
        features
    WHERE 
        featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
),
aggregated_data AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%' THEN 'protein_coding'
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="lncRNA"%' THEN 'lncRNA'
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%' THEN 'miRNA'
        END AS transcript_type,
        length
    FROM 
        transcript_lengths
)
SELECT 
    transcript_type,
    MIN(length) as min_length,
    MAX(length) as max_length,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as q1,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as median,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as q3
FROM 
    aggregated_data;
```

#### 4. Plotting with Python

Now, you can use Python to plot the boxplot:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Execute SQL query and load data into a DataFrame
query = """
WITH transcript_lengths AS (
    SELECT 
        attributes,
        end - start + 1 AS length
    FROM 
        features
    WHERE 
        featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
),
aggregated_data AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%' THEN 'protein_coding'
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="lncRNA"%' THEN 'lncRNA'
            WHEN attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%' THEN 'miRNA'
        END AS transcript_type,
        length
    FROM 
        transcript_lengths
)
SELECT 
    transcript_type,
    MIN(length) as min_length,
    MAX(length) as max_length,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as q1,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as median,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER (PARTITION BY transcript_type) as q3
FROM 
    aggregated_data;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Prepare data for boxplot
boxplot_data = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    boxplot_data.append({
        'transcript_type': row['transcript_type'],
        'lengths': [row['min_length'], row['q1'], row['median'], row['q3'], row['max_length']]
    })

# Convert to DataFrame
boxplot_df = pd.DataFrame(boxplot_data)

# Plotting with seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='transcript_type', y='lengths', data=boxplot_df)
plt.title('Comparison of Transcript Sizes')
plt.xlabel('Transcript Type')
plt.ylabel('Length (bp)')
plt.show()
```

This script will generate a boxplot comparing the sizes of `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcripts. Make sure to adjust the database connection details as needed for your environment.
