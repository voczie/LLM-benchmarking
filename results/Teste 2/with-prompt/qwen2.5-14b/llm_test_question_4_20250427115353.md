To determine how many miRNA genes exist on chromosome 10 using the provided SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database**: Use `sqlite3` or a similar library to connect to your SQLite database.
2. **Query for Genes**: Extract all gene features from chromosome 10 and filter by biotype (`gene_biotype`) to find miRNA genes.

### SQL Query

Here is an example of how you can write the query in Python using `sqlite3`:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the chromosome and gene biotype
chromosome = '10'
gene_biotype = 'miRNA'

# Query for miRNA genes on chromosome 10
query = f"""
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '{chromosome}'
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "{gene_biotype}"%';
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Print the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10
print(f"Number of miRNA genes on chromosome {chromosome}: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **`seqid = '{chromosome}'`**: Filters features to only those on chromosome 10.
- **`featuretype = 'gene'`**: Ensures we are querying for gene features specifically.
- **`attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "{gene_biotype}"%'`**: Checks if the `gene_biotype` attribute is set to "miRNA".

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that your database schema matches the expected format and that the attributes are correctly formatted in the `attributes` column.
- If you have a large dataset, consider optimizing the query by indexing relevant columns (e.g., `seqid`, `featuretype`, `attributes`).

This approach will give you an accurate count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10. Adjust the code as needed based on your specific database structure and requirements.

### Example Output

If there are 5 miRNA genes on chromosome 10, the output would be:

```
Number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10: 5
```
