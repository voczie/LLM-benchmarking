To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are present on chromosome 7 in the human genome annotation stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Use `sqlite3` or another Python library like `gffutils` to connect to your SQLite database.
2. **Query for lncRNA Genes**: Extract features of type "gene" with the attribute `gene_biotype` set to "lncRNA".
3. **Filter by Chromosome 7**: Ensure that these genes are located on chromosome 7.

Here's a step-by-step guide using Python and SQLite:

### Step 1: Connect to the Database

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install sqlite3
```

Then, connect to your SQLite database:
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

### Step 2: Query for lncRNA Genes on Chromosome 7

Use SQL queries to extract and count the genes of interest. The `attributes` column in your table is likely a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs, so you'll need to parse it.

Here's an example query:
```python
# Define the chromosome and gene type
chromosome = '7'
gene_type = 'lncRNA'

# Query for lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
query = f"""
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '{chromosome}' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "lncRNA"%';
"""

cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome {chromosome}: {result}")
```

### Step 3: Parse Attributes (if necessary)

If the `attributes` column is not directly searchable, you might need to parse it. Here's an example using Python to handle this:

```python
import re

# Define a function to extract gene biotype from attributes
def get_gene_biotype(attributes):
    match = re.search(r'gene_biotype "([^"]+)"', attributes)
    if match:
        return match.group(1)
    return None

# Query for genes on chromosome 7 and filter by lncRNA type
query = f"""
SELECT id, seqid, start, end, attributes
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '{chromosome}';
"""

cursor.execute(query)

lncrna_count = 0

for row in cursor.fetchall():
    gene_id, chrom, start, end, attrs = row
    biotype = get_gene_biotype(attrs)
    
    if biotype == 'lncRNA':
        lncrna_count += 1

print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome {chromosome}: {lncrna_count}")
```

### Step 4: Close the Database Connection

Don't forget to close the database connection after you're done:
```python
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

This approach ensures that you correctly count the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 by filtering and parsing the necessary attributes from your SQLite database.
