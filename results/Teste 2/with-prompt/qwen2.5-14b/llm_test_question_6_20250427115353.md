To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has and print their names along with their sizes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Gene ID**: First, find the `gene_id` for the XIST gene using its name.
2. **Retrieve Transcript IDs**: Use the gene ID to retrieve all associated transcript IDs.
3. **Calculate Transcript Sizes**: For each transcript, calculate the size based on the genomic coordinates provided in the GFF/GTF file.

Let's break down these steps with Python code using `gffutils` and SQLite database interaction:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

def get_gene_id(gene_name):
    # Query to find gene ID based on gene name (gene_name)
    cursor.execute("SELECT gene_id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%Name=\"{}\"%'".format(gene_name))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    if result:
        return result[0]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Gene {gene_name} not found in the database.")

def get_transcripts_for_gene(gene_id):
    # Query to find all transcripts associated with a given gene ID
    cursor.execute("SELECT transcript_id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%Parent=\"{}\"%'".format(gene_id))
    return [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

def calculate_transcript_size(transcript_id):
    # Query to get the start and end coordinates of each exon for a given transcript ID
    cursor.execute("SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%Parent=\"{}\"%' AND featuretype = 'exon'".format(transcript_id))
    exons = cursor.fetchall()
    
    if not exons:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the total size of the transcript by summing up exon lengths
    transcript_size = sum(end - start + 1 for start, end in exons)
    return transcript_size

def main():
    gene_name = "XIST"
    try:
        gene_id = get_gene_id(gene_name)
        print(f"Gene ID for {gene_name}: {gene_id}")
        
        transcripts = get_transcripts_for_gene(gene_id)
        print(f"{len(transcripts)} transcript isoforms found for the XIST gene.")
        
        # Print transcript names and sizes
        for transcript in transcripts:
            size = calculate_transcript_size(transcript)
            cursor.execute("SELECT attributes FROM features WHERE id = ?", (transcript,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            if result:
                attributes = dict(item.split('=') for item in result[0].split(';'))
                print(f"Transcript ID: {transcript}, Transcript Name: {attributes.get('transcript_name', 'N/A')}, Size: {size}")
    
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **get_gene_id**: This function queries the database to find the `gene_id` for a given gene name (e.g., "XIST").
2. **get_transcripts_for_gene**: This function retrieves all transcript IDs associated with a specific gene ID.
3. **calculate_transcript_size**: This function calculates the total size of each transcript by summing up the lengths of its exons.
4. **main**: The main function orchestrates these steps, prints the number of transcripts for XIST, and outputs their names along with their sizes.

### Running the Code:
- Ensure you have a properly set-up SQLite database containing the GFF/GTF data.
- Replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file path.
- Run the script to get the desired output.

This approach ensures that we accurately retrieve and process the necessary information from the database to answer the question about XIST gene transcript isoforms.
