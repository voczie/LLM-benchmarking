To determine how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the BRCA1 gene**: Find the `gene_id` for the BRCA1 gene using its name (`gene_name`).
2. **Find all transcripts associated with the BRCA1 gene**: Retrieve all transcript IDs that belong to this gene.
3. **Count exons for each transcript**: For each transcript, count the number of exons it contains.

Here's a step-by-step guide and code snippet to achieve this using `gffutils` or directly querying the SQLite database:

### Step 1: Identify the BRCA1 Gene
First, we need to find the gene ID for the BRCA1 gene. We can do this by querying the database for genes with the name "BRCA1".

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to get the gene_id of BRCA1
query_gene_id = """
SELECT gene_id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name="BRCA1"%';
"""

brca1_gene_id = cursor.execute(query_gene_id).fetchone()[0]
print(f"Gene ID for BRCA1: {brca1_gene_id}")
```

### Step 2: Find All Transcripts Associated with the BRCA1 Gene
Next, we need to find all transcript IDs associated with this gene.

```python
# Query to get all transcripts of the BRCA1 gene
query_transcripts = """
SELECT DISTINCT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = ? AND level = 0;
"""

transcript_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.execute(query_transcripts, (brca1_gene_id,)).fetchall()]
print(f"Transcript IDs of BRCA1: {transcript_ids}")
```

### Step 3: Count Exons for Each Transcript
Finally, we need to count the number of exons for each transcript.

```python
# Query to get exon counts for each transcript
query_exon_counts = """
SELECT child, COUNT(*) as exon_count 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent IN ({}) AND level = 1 
GROUP BY child;
"""

transcript_exon_counts = cursor.execute(query_exon_counts.format(','.join(['?'] * len(transcript_ids))), transcript_ids).fetchall()

# Print the results
for transcript_id, exon_count in transcript_exon_counts:
    print(f"Transcript ID: {transcript_id}, Number of Exons: {exon_count}")
```

### Full Code Example

Combining all steps into a single script:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_brca1_transcripts_and_exons(db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Step 1: Get BRCA1 gene ID
    query_gene_id = """
    SELECT gene_id 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name="BRCA1"%';
    """
    brca1_gene_id = cursor.execute(query_gene_id).fetchone()[0]

    # Step 2: Get all transcripts of the BRCA1 gene
    query_transcripts = """
    SELECT DISTINCT child 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent = ? AND level = 0;
    """
    transcript_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.execute(query_transcripts, (brca1_gene_id,)).fetchall()]

    # Step 3: Count exons for each transcript
    query_exon_counts = """
    SELECT child, COUNT(*) as exon_count 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent IN ({}) AND level = 1 
    GROUP BY child;
    """
    transcript_exon_counts = cursor.execute(query_exon_counts.format(','.join(['?'] * len(transcript_ids))), transcript_ids).fetchall()

    # Print the results
    for transcript_id, exon_count in transcript_exon_counts:
        print(f"Transcript ID: {transcript_id}, Number of Exons: {exon_count}")

    conn.close()

# Example usage
get_brca1_transcripts_and_exons('your_database.db')
```

This script will output the number of exons for each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene. Adjust the `db_path` variable to point to your actual database file.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the SQLite database is properly indexed and optimized for performance.
- The queries assume a specific schema and relationship structure in the database. If there are differences, adjust the queries accordingly.
- This example uses SQLite directly; if you prefer using `gffutils`, you can adapt the code to work with its API.

This approach should give you a clear count of exons for each transcript isoform of BRCA1.
