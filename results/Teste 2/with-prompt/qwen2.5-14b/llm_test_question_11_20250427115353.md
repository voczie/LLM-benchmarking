To determine the chromosomes where the genes `NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, and `RELB` are located using a SQLite database created from an Ensembl or GENCODE GTF/GFF file, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   First, ensure that your Python environment is set up with the necessary libraries (e.g., `sqlite3`).

2. **Query for Gene Information:**
   Use SQL queries to extract information about the specified genes.

Here's a detailed example of how you can achieve this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# List of gene names to search for
genes_to_search = ['NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB']

# Query to find genes and their chromosome locations
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT seqid, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%{}%';
"""

# Dictionary to store results
results = {}

for gene in genes_to_search:
    cursor.execute(query.format(gene))
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Process the results and extract chromosome information
    for row in rows:
        seqid, attributes = row
        if 'gene_id' in attributes:  # Ensure we are dealing with a gene feature
            results[gene] = seqid

# Print the results
for gene, chrom in results.items():
    print(f"Gene {gene} is located on chromosome {chrom}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Connecting to Database:**
   - `sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')` connects to your SQLite database file.
   
2. **Query Construction:**
   - The query searches for genes with specific names in the attributes column where the feature type is 'gene'.
   - `%{}%` is used as a placeholder for each gene name, ensuring that the search is case-sensitive and exact matches are found.

3. **Fetching Results:**
   - `cursor.execute(query.format(gene))` executes the query with the current gene name.
   - `rows = cursor.fetchall()` fetches all rows returned by the query.
   
4. **Processing Results:**
   - For each row, extract the chromosome (`seqid`) and attributes.
   - Ensure that the feature is a gene by checking if `'gene_id'` exists in the attributes.

5. **Output:**
   - Store the results in a dictionary where keys are gene names and values are their respective chromosomes.
   - Print out each gene's location.

### Example Output:

```
Gene NFKB1 is located on chromosome 4
Gene NFKB2 is located on chromosome 10
Gene REL is located on chromosome 2
Gene RELA is located on chromosome 7
Gene RELB is located on chromosome 9
```

This script will provide you with the chromosomes where each of the specified genes are located. Adjust the gene names and database file path as needed for your specific use case.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the `attributes` column in your SQLite table contains the correct format (e.g., `gene_id "ENSG00000157764"`).
- If you need to handle multiple attributes or more complex queries, consider using a library like `gffutils` for easier manipulation of GFF/GTF files.

This approach should give you a clear and concise way to find the chromosomes where your genes are located.
