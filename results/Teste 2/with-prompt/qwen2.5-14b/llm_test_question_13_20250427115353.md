To determine the biotypes of specific genes such as `XIST`, `MALAT1`, `BRCA1`, `NFKB1`, `NFKB2`, `REL`, `RELA`, `RELB`, and `COL1A2` from a GENCODE or Ensembl annotation stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database**: Use Python's `sqlite3` library to connect to your pre-loaded `.db` file.
2. **Query Gene Information**: Extract gene information for each specified gene and filter by their biotypes.

Here is a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# List of genes to query
genes_of_interest = ['XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2']

# Dictionary to store gene biotypes
gene_biotypes = {}

for gene in genes_of_interest:
    # Query the database for the specific gene's attributes
    query = f"""
    SELECT attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%{gene}%' OR attributes LIKE '%Name "{gene}"%';
    """
    
    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    
    if result:
        # Parse the attributes string to extract biotype
        attributes_str = result[0]
        gene_id_start = attributes_str.find('gene_id "')
        gene_id_end = attributes_str.find('"', gene_id_start + 9) + 1
        
        gene_id = attributes_str[gene_id_start:gene_id_end].replace('gene_id "', '')
        
        biotype_start = attributes_str.find(f'gene_biotype "{gene_id}" ')
        biotype_end = attributes_str.find('"', biotype_start + len(f'gene_biotype "{gene_id}" '))
        
        if biotype_start != -1 and biotype_end != -1:
            gene_biotypes[gene] = attributes_str[biotype_start:biotype_end].replace('gene_biotype "', '').strip()
    
# Print the results
for gene, biotype in gene_biotypes.items():
    print(f"Gene {gene}: Biotype is {biotype}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Connecting to Database**: The `sqlite3.connect` function connects to your SQLite database file.
2. **Querying Gene Information**:
   - For each gene, a SQL query is constructed to find the corresponding row in the `features` table where the feature type is 'gene' and the attributes contain the gene name or ID.
   - The `LIKE` clause is used to match the gene names or IDs within the attributes string.
3. **Parsing Attributes**:
   - Once a matching row is found, the attributes string is parsed to extract the biotype information.
4. **Storing Results**: The extracted biotypes are stored in a dictionary and printed out.

### Example Output

The output will be similar to:

```
Gene XIST: Biotype is lncRNA
Gene MALAT1: Biotype is lncRNA
Gene BRCA1: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene NFKB1: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene NFKB2: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene REL: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene RELA: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene RELB: Biotype is protein_coding
Gene COL1A2: Biotype is protein_coding
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the gene names or IDs are correctly formatted in your queries.
- The `attributes` field typically contains a string with key-value pairs separated by semicolons. You may need to adjust parsing logic if the format differs from what's assumed here.

This approach should work for most standard GENCODE and Ensembl annotations stored in SQLite databases.
