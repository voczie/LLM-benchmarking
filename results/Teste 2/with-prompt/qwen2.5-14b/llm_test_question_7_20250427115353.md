To determine how many exons the XIST gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the `gene_id` for the XIST gene.
2. Retrieve all transcript IDs associated with this gene.
3. Find all exon features that belong to each of these transcripts.

Let's break down the process using Python and the `gffutils` library, which is a convenient tool for working with GFF/GTF files in SQLite databases.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Identify the XIST gene ID:**
   - Query the database to find the `gene_id` of the XIST gene.
   
2. **Retrieve transcript IDs associated with the XIST gene:**
   - Use the relations table to get all transcripts that belong to this gene.

3. **Find exon features for each transcript:**
   - Retrieve all exons that are children of these transcripts.

### Python Code Implementation

First, ensure you have `gffutils` installed:
```sh
pip install gffutils
```

Now, let's write the code:

```python
import sqlite3
from gffutils import FeatureDB

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'
db = FeatureDB(db_path)

# Step 1: Identify the XIST gene ID
xist_gene_id = None
for feature in db.features_of_type('gene'):
    if feature['gene_name'] == 'XIST':
        xist_gene_id = feature['ID']
        break

if not xist_gene_id:
    raise ValueError("XIST gene not found")

# Step 2: Retrieve transcript IDs associated with the XIST gene
transcript_ids = set()
for relation in db.children(xist_gene_id, featuretype='transcript', level=0):
    transcript_ids.add(relation['ID'])

if not transcript_ids:
    raise ValueError("No transcripts found for XIST")

# Step 3: Find exon features for each transcript
exon_count = 0
for transcript_id in transcript_ids:
    exons = db.children(transcript_id, featuretype='exon', level=1)
    exon_count += len(list(exons))

print(f"The XIST gene has {exon_count} exons.")
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** We iterate through all genes and find the one with `gene_name` equal to 'XIST'. Once found, we store its `ID`.
  
- **Step 2:** Using the relations table, we retrieve all transcripts that are children of the XIST gene. This is done by querying for features where the parent ID matches the XIST gene ID.

- **Step 3:** For each transcript, we count the number of exons it contains and sum these counts to get the total number of exons for the XIST gene.

### Running the Code

Make sure you have your database path correctly set in `db_path`. Run the script, and it will output the number of exons associated with the XIST gene.

This approach ensures that we accurately count all exons related to the XIST gene by leveraging the relationships defined in the GFF/GTF file.
