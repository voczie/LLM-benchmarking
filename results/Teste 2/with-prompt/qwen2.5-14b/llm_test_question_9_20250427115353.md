To calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the BRCA1 gene and its associated transcripts**.
2. **Extract all exons for each BRCA1 transcript**.
3. **Calculate the sizes of these exons**.
4. **Compute the average exon size**.

Let's break down the process with a step-by-step walkthrough using Python and `gffutils`, which is a convenient library to handle GFF/GTF files and SQLite databases.

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install gffutils sqlite3
```

Next, load your database into memory:

```python
import gffutils
from collections import defaultdict

# Load the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db')
```

### Step 2: Identify BRCA1 Gene and Transcripts

We need to find the `gene` feature for BRCA1. We can use the gene ID or name to filter:

```python
brca1_gene_id = 'ENSG00000139607'  # Example ENSG ID for BRCA1
brca1_gene = db[gene_id]
```

### Step 3: Extract Exons for Each Transcript

Now, we need to find all transcripts associated with the BRCA1 gene and then extract their exons:

```python
transcripts = [t for t in db.children(brca1_gene, featuretype='transcript', level=0)]
exon_sizes = defaultdict(list)

for transcript in transcripts:
    for exon in db.children(transcript.id, featuretype='exon'):
        exon_size = exon.end - exon.start + 1
        exon_sizes[transcript.id].append(exon_size)
```

### Step 4: Calculate Average Exon Size

Finally, we calculate the average size of exons for each transcript and then compute the overall average:

```python
average_exon_sizes = []

for transcript_id, sizes in exon_sizes.items():
    avg_size = sum(sizes) / len(sizes)
    average_exon_sizes.append(avg_size)

overall_average_exon_size = sum(average_exon_sizes) / len(average_exon_sizes)
```

### Full Code Example

Here is the complete code to achieve this:

```python
import gffutils
from collections import defaultdict

# Load the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db')

# BRCA1 gene ID (example ENSG ID)
brca1_gene_id = 'ENSG00000139607'

# Get the BRCA1 gene feature
brca1_gene = db[brca1_gene_id]

# Find all transcripts associated with the BRCA1 gene
transcripts = [t for t in db.children(brca1_gene, featuretype='transcript', level=0)]

# Dictionary to store exon sizes per transcript
exon_sizes = defaultdict(list)

for transcript in transcripts:
    for exon in db.children(transcript.id, featuretype='exon'):
        exon_size = exon.end - exon.start + 1
        exon_sizes[transcript.id].append(exon_size)

# Calculate average exon size for each transcript and overall average
average_exon_sizes = []

for transcript_id, sizes in exon_sizes.items():
    avg_size = sum(sizes) / len(sizes)
    average_exon_sizes.append(avg_size)

overall_average_exon_size = sum(average_exon_sizes) / len(average_exon_sizes)

print(f"Overall Average Exon Size for BRCA1 Transcript Isoforms: {overall_average_exon_size}")
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: We load the database and identify the BRCA1 gene using its ID.
- **Step 2**: We find all transcripts associated with the BRCA1 gene.
- **Step 3**: For each transcript, we extract exons and calculate their sizes.
- **Step 4**: We compute the average exon size for each transcript and then the overall average.

This approach ensures that you get a precise calculation of the average exon size for all BRCA1 transcript isoforms.
