To determine how many protein-coding genes are on chromosome 12 using the provided SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database**: Use `sqlite3` or a similar library to connect to your SQLite database.
2. **Query for Protein-Coding Genes**: Extract all features that are protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.
3. **Count the Features**: Count the number of such genes.

### Python Code Example

Here's how you can achieve this using Python and `sqlite3`:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query for protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%'
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Print the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
print(f"Number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Connecting to the Database**: The `sqlite3.connect` function is used to establish a connection to your SQLite database file.
- **Query Construction**:
  - `seqid = '12'`: Filters features on chromosome 12.
  - `featuretype = 'gene'`: Ensures we are looking at genes.
  - `attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%'`: Checks if the gene is protein-coding by searching for the term "protein_coding" in the attributes column. This assumes that the attribute string contains this exact phrase, which might vary depending on your specific annotation format.
- **Executing and Fetching Results**: The query is executed using `cursor.execute`, and the result is fetched with `fetchone`.
- **Printing the Result**: Finally, the number of protein-coding genes is printed.

### Notes

- Ensure that the attribute string in your database contains "protein_coding" for protein-coding genes. If it uses a different format (e.g., `gene_biotype="protein_coding"`), you may need to adjust the query accordingly.
- The schema provided includes an `attributes` column, which typically stores key-value pairs like `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, and `gene_biotype`. You might need to parse this string if it's not directly searchable.

### Example Adjustments

If your database uses a different format for storing gene biotypes (e.g., JSON-like attributes), you may need to adjust the query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_biotype') = 'protein_coding'
```

This assumes that `attributes` is stored in a JSON-like format and you can use `json_extract` to query specific attributes.

### Final Output

Running the provided Python script will give you the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12, which you can then use for further analysis or reporting.
