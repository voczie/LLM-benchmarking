To find which genes are located between the `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` genes on both the positive (+) and negative (-) strands, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12**.
2. **Find all genes within those ranges**.

Here's a step-by-step guide using Python with `gffutils` or SQLite3 to achieve this:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install gffutils sqlite3
```

### Step 2: Load and Query the Database

#### Using `gffutils`
If your database is in a GFF/GTF format and has been converted to a SQLite database using `gffutils`, you can use it directly.

```python
import gffutils

# Load the database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db')

# Query for HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes
hoxc11 = db['HOXC11']
hoxc12 = db['HOXC12']

if hoxc11 is None or hoxc12 is None:
    raise ValueError("HOXC11 or HOXC12 not found in the database")

# Get positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12
start_hoxc11, end_hoxc11 = min(hoxc11.start, hoxc11.end), max(hoxc11.start, hoxc11.end)
start_hoxc12, end_hoxc12 = min(hoxc12.start, hoxc12.end), max(hoxc12.start, hoxc12.end)

# Ensure the start and end positions are in order
if start_hoxc11 > start_hoxc12:
    start_hoxc11, start_hoxc12 = start_hoxc12, start_hoxc11
    end_hoxc11, end_hoxc12 = end_hoxc12, end_hoxc11

# Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands
genes_between = db.region(seqid=hoxc11.chrom, start=start_hoxc11 + 1, end=end_hoxc12 - 1, featuretype='gene')

for gene in genes_between:
    print(f"Gene: {gene.id}, Start: {gene.start}, End: {gene.end}, Strand: {gene.strand}")
```

#### Using SQLite3
If you are using raw SQLite queries:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query for HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes
cursor.execute("SELECT seqid, start, end, strand FROM features WHERE id IN ('HOXC11', 'HOXC12')")
hoxc_genes = cursor.fetchall()

if len(hoxc_genes) != 2:
    raise ValueError("HOXC11 or HOXC12 not found in the database")

# Extract positions and strands
start_hoxc11, end_hoxc11, strand_hoxc11 = hoxc_genes[0][1], hoxc_genes[0][2], hoxc_genes[0][3]
start_hoxc12, end_hoxc12, strand_hoxc12 = hoxc_genes[1][1], hoxc_genes[1][2], hoxc_genes[1][3]

# Ensure the start and end positions are in order
if start_hoxc11 > start_hoxc12:
    start_hoxc11, start_hoxc12 = start_hoxc12, start_hoxc11
    end_hoxc11, end_hoxc12 = end_hoxc12, end_hoxc11

# Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands
cursor.execute("""
SELECT id, seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype='gene' AND seqid=? AND start BETWEEN ? AND ? AND strand IN (?, ?)
""", (hoxc_genes[0][0], start_hoxc11 + 1, end_hoxc12 - 1, strand_hoxc11, strand_hoxc12))

genes_between = cursor.fetchall()

for gene in genes_between:
    print(f"Gene: {gene[0]}, Start: {gene[2]}, End: {gene[3]}, Strand: {gene[4]}")
```

### Explanation
- **Identify Positions**: First, we identify the start and end positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.
- **Find Genes Between Ranges**: We then query for genes within the range between these two genes on both strands.

This approach ensures that you correctly find all genes located strictly between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`, considering their positions and strands. Adjust the paths and database names as necessary to fit your specific setup. 

### Output
The output will list all genes found within the specified range, along with their start and end coordinates and strand information.

This should give you a clear understanding of which genes are located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`. If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask! ðŸš€
