To determine the strand on which the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located in a human genome annotation stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   First, connect to your SQLite database using Python's `sqlite3` library.

2. **Query for Gene Information:**
   Use SQL queries to retrieve the strand information for each gene of interest (HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12).

### Example Code

Here is a complete example in Python that connects to your SQLite database and retrieves the strand information for the specified genes:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# List of gene names to query
genes_of_interest = ['HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12']

# Dictionary to store results
gene_strand_info = {}

for gene in genes_of_interest:
    # Query the database for the strand information of the gene
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=gene:{0};%'
    """.format(gene))
    
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    
    if result:
        chromosome, start, end, strand = result
        gene_strand_info[gene] = {'chromosome': chromosome, 'start': start, 'end': end, 'strand': strand}
    else:
        print(f"Gene {gene} not found in the database.")

# Print the results
for gene, info in gene_strand_info.items():
    print(f"{gene}:")
    print(f"  Chromosome: {info['chromosome']}")
    print(f"  Start: {info['start']}")
    print(f"  End: {info['end']}")
    print(f"  Strand: {info['strand']}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

1. **Connecting to the Database:**
   - `sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')`: Connects to your SQLite database file.
   
2. **Querying for Gene Information:**
   - The SQL query uses a LIKE clause to match the gene ID in the attributes column, which typically contains information like `ID=gene:HOTAIR;`.
   - For each gene of interest, the script fetches the chromosome, start position, end position, and strand from the database.
   
3. **Storing Results:**
   - The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys are the gene names and the values are dictionaries containing the chromosome, start, end, and strand information.

4. **Printing Results:**
   - Finally, the script prints out the strand information for each gene.

### Notes

- Ensure that your database schema matches the expected format.
- Adjust the query if necessary based on how gene IDs are stored in your specific annotation file (e.g., `gene_id` attribute instead of `ID=gene:`).
- If you have multiple genes with the same name but different attributes, you may need to refine the query further.

This script will help you determine the strand information for HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes in your SQLite database.
