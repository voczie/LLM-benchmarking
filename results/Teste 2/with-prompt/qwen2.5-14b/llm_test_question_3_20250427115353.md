To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome in the human genome annotation stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Pseudogene Features**: First, identify all features that are classified as pseudogenes.
2. **Filter by Chromosome**: Then, filter those features to only include those on the X chromosome.

Here's how you can achieve this using Python and `sqlite3` or a similar library like `gffutils`.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
   
2. **Query for Pseudogenes on X Chromosome**:
   - Write a SQL query to select all pseudogene features on chromosome X.

Here's an example Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the query to find pseudogenes on chromosome X
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype IN (
    'processed_pseudogene', 
    'transcribed_processed_pseudogene',
    'translated_processed_pseudogene',
    'unitary_pseudogene',
    'unprocessed_pseudogene'
);
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Print the number of pseudogenes on chromosome X
print(f"Number of pseudogenes on chromosome X: {result[0]}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

1. **Database Connection**:
   - `sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')`: Connects to your SQLite database file.
   
2. **SQL Query**:
   - The query selects all features that are pseudogenes (`featuretype` in a list of known pseudogene types) and located on chromosome X (`seqid = 'X'`).
   - `COUNT(*)` is used to count the number of such features.

3. **Execution and Fetching Results**:
   - The query is executed using `cursor.execute(query)`.
   - The result is fetched with `cursor.fetchone()`, which returns a single row containing the count.
   
4. **Output**:
   - The script prints out the total number of pseudogenes on chromosome X.

5. **Close Connection**:
   - Finally, close the database connection to free up resources.

### Additional Considerations

- If you need more detailed information about each pseudogene (e.g., gene ID, attributes), modify the query accordingly.
- Ensure that your database schema matches the expected structure and attribute names as described in the provided schema.

This script should give you a clear count of pseudogenes on chromosome X. Adjust the feature types or other parameters as needed based on specific requirements or additional details from your dataset.
