To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 in the human genome annotation stored in a SQLite database, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Genes**: Extract all features of type `gene` from chromosome 3.
2. **Identify Transcripts**: For each gene, extract its associated transcripts.

Here's how you can achieve this using Python and the `gffutils` library to interact with the SQLite database:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have `gffutils` installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   pip install gffutils
   ```

2. **Load Database and Query**:
   Use the following Python code to load the database and query for genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query for all gene features on chromosome 3
gene_query = """
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT parent) AS num_genes 
FROM relations 
JOIN features ON relations.parent = features.id 
WHERE features.seqid = '3' AND features.featuretype = 'gene';
"""

transcript_query = """
WITH RECURSIVE transcripts AS (
    SELECT child FROM relations WHERE level = 1
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.child) AS num_transcripts 
FROM transcripts t 
JOIN features f ON t.child = f.id 
WHERE f.seqid = '3' AND f.featuretype IN ('transcript', 'mRNA');
"""

# Execute the gene query
cursor.execute(gene_query)
gene_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Execute the transcript query
cursor.execute(transcript_query)
transcript_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"Number of genes on chromosome 3: {gene_count}")
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: {transcript_count}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

1. **Gene Query**:
   - The query counts distinct `parent` entries in the `relations` table where the parent is a gene (`featuretype = 'gene'`) and located on chromosome 3.
   
2. **Transcript Query**:
   - A Common Table Expression (CTE) named `transcripts` is used to identify all children of genes at level 1, which typically represent transcripts.
   - The main query then counts distinct transcript IDs (`child`) from the CTE that are located on chromosome 3 and have a feature type of either 'transcript' or 'mRNA'.

### Output
The script will print out the number of genes and transcripts found on chromosome 3.

```python
Number of genes on chromosome 3: <gene_count>
Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: <transcript_count>
```

Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will give you a clear count of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `relations` table correctly links features (genes, transcripts) as per the GFF/GTF format.
- The schema provided suggests that the `features` table contains detailed information about each feature type, while the `relations` table captures hierarchical relationships between them.

This approach should provide a robust and efficient way to count genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 using SQLite queries.
