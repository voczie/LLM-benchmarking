To find the names of the two genes located immediately before and after the gene `COL1A2` in a human genome annotation database using GFF/GTF format stored in SQLite3, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the location of COL1A2**: Find the chromosome and coordinates (start and end) of the `COL1A2` gene.
2. **Retrieve genes on the same chromosome**: Fetch all genes on the same chromosome as `COL1A2`.
3. **Sort genes by their start positions**.
4. **Find the immediate neighbors**: Identify the genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`.

Let's break down these steps with Python code using the `gffutils` library to interact with the SQLite database.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install gffutils sqlite3
```

#### 2. Load and Query the Database

Here's a Python script that performs the required steps:

```python
import gffutils
from collections import defaultdict

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_file = 'path_to_your_database.db'
db = gffutils.FeatureDB(db_file)

# Step 1: Identify the location of COL1A2 gene
col1a2_gene = db["COL1A2"]
chromosome = col1a2_gene.chrom
start_pos = col1a2_gene.start
end_pos = col1a2_gene.end

# Step 2: Retrieve all genes on the same chromosome as COL1A2
genes_on_chromosome = list(db.features_of_type('gene', order_by='start', limit=None, featuretype=['gene'], sequence=chromosome))

# Step 3: Find the immediate neighbors of COL1A2 gene
previous_gene_name = None
next_gene_name = None

for gene in genes_on_chromosome:
    if gene.id == "COL1A2":
        previous_gene_name = next((g.name for g in genes_on_chromosome if g.start < start_pos), None)
        next_gene_name = next((g.name for g in genes_on_chromosome if g.start > end_pos), None)

# Print the names of the immediate neighbors
print(f"Gene immediately before COL1A2: {previous_gene_name}")
print(f"Gene immediately after COL1A2: {next_gene_name}")
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: We retrieve the `COL1A2` gene from the database and extract its chromosome, start position, and end position.
  
- **Step 2**: We fetch all genes on the same chromosome as `COL1A2`. The `order_by='start'` parameter ensures that the genes are sorted by their starting positions.

- **Step 3**: We iterate through the list of genes to find the gene immediately before and after `COL1A2`.

### Notes

- Ensure you replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
- The script assumes that the gene names are stored in the `name` attribute. If they are stored differently, adjust accordingly.

This approach ensures that we accurately find and print the names of the genes immediately adjacent to `COL1A2`.
