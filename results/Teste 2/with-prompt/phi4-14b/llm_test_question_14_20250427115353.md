To determine the strands on which the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located using a GFF/GTF formatted database stored in SQLite3, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access the Database:**
   - Use Python with libraries like `sqlite3` to connect to your database.

2. **Identify Gene IDs:**
   - First, identify the gene IDs for HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12. This information is typically found in the attributes column of the GFF/GTF file.
   - The attribute format usually looks like this:
     ```
     gene_id "GENEID"; transcript_id "TRANSCRIPTID";
     ```

3. **Query the Database:**
   - Use SQL queries to extract the strand information for these genes.

4. **SQL Query Construction:**
   - You will need to query the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'gene' and match the gene IDs.
   - Extract the `strand` column for each of these genes.

Here's a sample Python script using `sqlite3`:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the gene names you are interested in
genes_of_interest = ['HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12']

# Prepare a query to find the strand for each gene
query_template = """
SELECT attributes, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE ?
"""

# Execute the query and fetch results
results = {}
for gene in genes_of_interest:
    # Use SQL's LIKE operator to search for the gene_id within the attributes column
    cursor.execute(query_template, (f'%gene_id "{gene}";%',))
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    
    if row:
        attributes, strand = row
        results[gene] = strand

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# Print the results
for gene, strand in results.items():
    print(f"The {gene} gene is located on the {strand} strand.")
```

### Explanation:

- **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
- **Query Template:** Use a SQL query template that searches for genes by matching their `gene_id` within the `attributes` column using the `%LIKE%` operator.
- **Loop Through Genes:** For each gene of interest, execute the query and fetch the strand information.
- **Store Results:** Store the results in a dictionary for easy access and printing.

### Output:

The script will output which strand (positive or negative) each of the specified genes is located on. This approach ensures you accurately retrieve the strand information based on the gene IDs from your GFF/GTF formatted database.
