To determine how many protein-coding genes are located on chromosome 12 using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps. The key is to query the `features` table for entries that match both the criteria of being a gene and having a specific biotype indicating they are protein-coding.

### Step-by-Step Query Walkthrough

1. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns:**
   - You need to access the `features` table, which contains genomic feature data.
   - The relevant columns for this query include:
     - `seqid`: This column specifies the chromosome identifier (e.g., "12" for chromosome 12).
     - `featuretype`: This should be "gene" since we are interested in genes.
     - `attributes`: This column contains additional information, including gene biotype.

2. **Filter by Chromosome:**
   - Use a condition to filter rows where the `seqid` is "12".

3. **Filter by Feature Type:**
   - Ensure that only entries with `featuretype` as "gene" are considered.

4. **Extract Gene Biotype from Attributes:**
   - The `attributes` column contains key-value pairs, including `gene_biotype`. You need to parse this column to extract the biotype.
   - Use SQLite's string functions to locate and extract the value associated with `gene_biotype`.

5. **Filter by Protein-Coding Biotype:**
   - Check if the extracted `gene_biotype` is "protein_coding".

6. **Count the Results:**
   - Finally, count the number of entries that meet all these criteria.

### SQL Query

Here's how you can construct the query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '12'
  AND featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "protein_coding"%';
```

### Explanation

- **`seqid = '12'`:** Filters entries to only those on chromosome 12.
- **`featuretype = 'gene'`:** Ensures we are looking at gene features.
- **`attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "protein_coding"'%`:** This condition checks if the `attributes` column contains a key-value pair where `gene_biotype` is set to `"protein_coding"`. The `%` wildcards allow for other text before and after this specific attribute.

### Running the Query

- Execute this query in your SQLite environment. It will return the count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

This approach efficiently narrows down the dataset using conditions that match your criteria, leveraging SQL's string manipulation capabilities to parse complex attribute data.
