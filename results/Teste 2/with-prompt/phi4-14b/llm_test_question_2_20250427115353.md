To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are located on chromosome 7 using your GFF/GTF formatted data stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   First, establish a connection to your SQLite database where the annotation data is stored.

2. **Query for lncRNA Genes on Chromosome 7:**
   You need to filter the `features` table to find entries that are of type `gene`, have a `gene_biotype` attribute of `lncRNA`, and are located on chromosome 7 (`seqid = '7'`). The `attributes` column contains key-value pairs, so you'll need to parse it to extract the `gene_biotype`.

3. **SQL Query:**
   Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT attributes->>'gene_id') AS lncRNA_gene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
     AND seqid = '7'
     AND json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_biotype') = 'lncRNA';
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `featuretype = 'gene'`: Filters entries to only include genes.
   - `seqid = '7'`: Ensures the gene is on chromosome 7.
   - `json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_biotype') = 'lncRNA'`: Extracts and checks if the `gene_biotype` attribute is `lncRNA`. The `json_extract` function is used to parse JSON-like strings in SQLite.

4. **Execute the Query:**
   Use a Python script with an appropriate library like `sqlite3` or `gffutils` to execute this query against your database.

### Example Code Using `sqlite3`

Here's how you might implement this using Python and the `sqlite3` library:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_id')) AS lncRNA_gene_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND seqid = '7'
  AND json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_biotype') = 'lncRNA';
"""

cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Output the result
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Key Considerations

- **Database Path:** Ensure you provide the correct path to your SQLite database file.
- **JSON Parsing:** The `json_extract` function is used here because the `attributes` column in GFF/GTF files can be parsed as JSON. This approach assumes that your SQLite version supports JSON functions (SQLite 3.33.0 and later).
- **Attributes Format:** Ensure that the attributes are stored in a format compatible with JSON extraction.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 from your annotated genome data.
