To determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a series of queries. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Identify the Gene ID for BRCA1

First, we need to find the `gene_id` associated with the BRCA1 gene. This can be done by querying the `features` table where the `attributes` column contains information about genes.

```sql
SELECT attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

This query will return a row containing the `attributes` field, which includes various details about the gene. You need to extract the `gene_id` from this string. The `attributes` column is typically formatted as key-value pairs separated by semicolons.

### Step 2: Extract the Gene ID

Assuming the output of the previous query looks something like:

```
gene_id "ENSG00000139618"; gene_name "BRCA1";
```

You can extract the `gene_id` using a string manipulation function in SQLite. Here's how you might do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    substr(attributes, instr(attributes, 'gene_id "') + 8,
           instr(attributes, '"', instr(attributes, 'gene_id "') + 8) - 
           (instr(attributes, 'gene_id "') + 8)) AS gene_id
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

This query extracts the `gene_id` by locating the positions of the relevant substrings.

### Step 3: Find Chromosomal Position

Once you have the `gene_id`, use it to find the chromosomal position. The `features` table contains information about genes, including their start and end positions on chromosomes (`seqid`).

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ENSG00000139618%';
```

Replace `ENSG00000139618` with the actual `gene_id` you extracted in Step 2.

### Step 4: Interpret the Results

The result of this query will give you:

- `seqid`: The chromosome number or letter (e.g., 17 for BRCA1).
- `start`: The starting position of the gene on the chromosome.
- `end`: The ending position of the gene on the chromosome.

For example, if the output is:

```
seqid | start   | end
---------------------
17    | 41196311| 41277499
```

This indicates that the BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17, starting at position 41,196,311 and ending at position 41,277,499.

### Summary

By following these steps, you can determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using your SQLite database. Adjust the queries as needed based on the actual format of your `attributes` column if it differs from the example provided.
