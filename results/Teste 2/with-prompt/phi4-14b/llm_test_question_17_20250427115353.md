To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using data from a GFF/GTF format stored in an SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   Use Python's `sqlite3` library to connect to your database.

2. **Query Gene Data:**
   Extract gene features from the X chromosome and calculate their sizes. The size of a gene is determined by the difference between its end and start positions.

3. **Filter for Protein-Coding Genes (Optional):**
   If you want to focus on protein-coding genes, filter based on the `gene_biotype` attribute.

4. **Generate Scatterplot:**
   Use a plotting library like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create the scatterplot.

### Detailed Implementation

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to get gene sizes on the X chromosome
query = """
SELECT 
    start, 
    end, 
    attributes 
FROM 
    features 
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND 
    seqid = 'X'
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)
genes = cursor.fetchall()

# Calculate gene sizes and filter for protein-coding genes if needed
gene_sizes = []
for start, end, attributes in genes:
    # Parse attributes to get gene_biotype
    attr_dict = {key: value.strip('"') for key, value in 
                 (item.split(' ') for item in attributes.split(';') if item)}
    
    # Calculate size
    size = end - start
    
    # Optionally filter for protein-coding genes
    if attr_dict.get('gene_biotype') == 'protein_coding':
        gene_sizes.append(size)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()

# Generate scatterplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(range(len(gene_sizes)), gene_sizes, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on X Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Gene Index')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation

- **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
  
- **Query Execution:** Use an SQL query to select genes from the X chromosome. The `featuretype` is set to 'gene', and `seqid` is 'X'.

- **Attribute Parsing:** Extract attributes from the GFF/GTF format, which are stored as a semicolon-separated string in the database.

- **Gene Size Calculation:** Compute the size of each gene by subtracting the start position from the end position.

- **Filtering (Optional):** If you want to focus on protein-coding genes, filter based on the `gene_biotype` attribute.

- **Scatterplot Creation:** Use Matplotlib to create a scatterplot. Each point represents a gene, with its index on the x-axis and size on the y-axis.

This approach provides a visual representation of gene sizes on the X chromosome, allowing you to analyze their distribution effectively. Adjust the filtering criteria as needed for your specific analysis requirements.
