To determine the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using a GFF/GTF formatted database stored in SQLite, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   Use `sqlite3` or `gffutils` to connect to your `.db` file.

2. **Identify BRCA1 Transcript Isoforms:**
   You need to find all transcript isoforms associated with the BRCA1 gene. This involves querying for transcripts that have a parent-child relationship with the BRCA1 gene in the database.

3. **Extract Exon Features:**
   For each identified transcript, extract exon features. These are typically marked as `exon` in the `featuretype`.

4. **Calculate Exon Sizes:**
   Calculate the size of each exon by subtracting the start position from the end position for each exon feature.

5. **Compute Average Exon Size:**
   For each transcript, compute the average exon size and then calculate the overall average across all transcripts.

### SQL Query

Here's a structured approach using SQL:

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify BRCA1 gene ID
SELECT id INTO TEMP brca1_gene_id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1";%';

-- Step 2: Find all transcript isoforms related to the BRCA1 gene
WITH RECURSIVE TranscriptIsoforms AS (
    SELECT child AS transcript_id
    FROM relations
    WHERE parent = (SELECT id FROM brca1_gene_id)
      AND level = 1 -- Level 1 indicates direct children, which are transcripts
)

-- Step 3: Extract exon features for each transcript isoform
SELECT 
    f.seqid,
    f.start,
    f.end,
    t.transcript_id
INTO TEMP ExonFeatures
FROM 
    features f
JOIN 
    TranscriptIsoforms t ON f.id = t.transcript_id
WHERE 
    f.featuretype = 'exon';

-- Step 4: Calculate exon sizes and average per transcript
SELECT 
    transcript_id,
    AVG(end - start) AS avg_exon_size
INTO TEMP AvgExonSizesPerTranscript
FROM 
    ExonFeatures
GROUP BY 
    transcript_id;

-- Step 5: Compute the overall average exon size across all transcripts
SELECT 
    AVG(avg_exon_size) AS overall_avg_exon_size
FROM 
    AvgExonSizesPerTranscript;
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** Identify the gene ID for BRCA1 using a query on the `features` table.
  
- **Step 2:** Use a recursive common table expression (CTE) to find all transcript isoforms related to the BRCA1 gene.

- **Step 3:** Extract exon features for each identified transcript isoform.

- **Step 4:** Calculate the size of each exon and compute the average exon size per transcript.

- **Step 5:** Finally, calculate the overall average exon size across all transcripts.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that your database schema matches the expected structure.
- Adjust attribute parsing if necessary, as GFF/GTF formats can vary slightly.
- Use `gffutils` for more complex queries or if you prefer a Pythonic approach to interact with the database.

This query will give you the average exon size of all BRCA1 transcript isoforms stored in your SQLite database.
