To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps. We'll use SQL queries to interact with the `features` table in your database schema.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema**: 
   - The `features` table contains genomic features such as genes and pseudogenes.
   - Relevant columns for this query are:
     - `seqid`: Chromosome identifier (e.g., "X" for the X chromosome).
     - `featuretype`: Type of feature (e.g., "gene").
     - `attributes`: Contains additional information, including gene biotype.

2. **Identify Pseudogenes**:
   - Pseudogenes are identified by their `gene_biotype` attribute within the `attributes` column.
   - Common pseudogene types include: `processed_pseudogene`, `unitary_pseudogene`, `transcribed_processed_pseudogene`, etc.

3. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - We need to filter entries where `seqid = 'X'` and `featuretype = 'gene'`.
   - Extract the `gene_biotype` from the `attributes` column and check if it matches any pseudogene type.

4. **SQL Query**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X'
  AND featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "%processed_pseudogene"%'
  OR attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "%unitary_pseudogene"%'
  OR attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "%transcribed_processed_pseudogene"%'
  OR attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "%transcribed_unitary_pseudogene"%'
  OR attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "%unprocessed_pseudogene"%';
```

### Explanation

- **`seqid = 'X'`**: Filters features on the X chromosome.
- **`featuretype = 'gene'`**: Ensures we are looking at gene entries.
- **`attributes LIKE ...`**: Searches for specific pseudogene types within the `attributes` column. The `%` wildcard allows for matching any text before or after the specified pattern.

### Running the Query

1. Connect to your SQLite database using a tool like `sqlite3`, Python's `sqlite3` module, or any other SQL client.
2. Execute the query above.
3. The result will give you the count of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

This approach ensures that you accurately identify and count all relevant pseudogene entries based on their biotype attributes.
