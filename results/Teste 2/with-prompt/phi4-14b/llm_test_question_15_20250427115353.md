To determine which genes are located between the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes on both the positive (+) and negative (-) strands, we can follow a structured approach using SQL queries. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the Positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12:**
   - First, retrieve the start and end positions for both HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes from the `features` table.

2. **Determine Strand Orientation:**
   - Check the strand orientation (`+` or `-`) for each gene to ensure you are considering the correct order of genes on the chromosome.

3. **Query Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12:**
   - Depending on the strand, query for genes that lie between the start and end positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12.

### SQL Queries

#### Step 1: Retrieve Positions and Strands

```sql
-- Get details for HOXC11
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "HOXC11"%';

-- Get details for HOXC12
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "HOXC12"%';
```

#### Step 2: Query Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12

Assuming you have retrieved the following information:
- **HOXC11**: `seqid`, `start1`, `end1`, `strand1`
- **HOXC12**: `seqid`, `start2`, `end2`, `strand2`

Use these values to construct your queries:

```sql
-- For genes on the positive strand (+)
SELECT attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chrX'  -- Replace with actual chromosome ID from HOXC11/12
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (
    (strand1 = '+' AND start1 < start2) OR (strand1 = '-' AND end1 > end2)
)
AND (
    ((start > start1 AND start < end2) OR (end > start1 AND end < end2))
);

-- For genes on the negative strand (-)
SELECT attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chrX'  -- Replace with actual chromosome ID from HOXC11/12
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND (
    (strand1 = '-' AND start1 > start2) OR (strand1 = '+' AND end1 < end2)
)
AND (
    ((start > start2 AND start < end1) OR (end > start2 AND end < end1))
);
```

### Explanation

- **Strand Consideration**: The queries are split based on the strand orientation. For the positive strand, genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 are those with start positions greater than `start1` and less than `end2`. For the negative strand, it's reversed.
  
- **Chromosome ID**: Replace `'chrX'` with the actual chromosome identifier obtained from the initial queries.

- **Attributes Filtering**: The `attributes` field is filtered to include only gene entries. You may need to parse this field further if you want specific gene IDs or names.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that the database schema and data are consistent with the assumptions made in these queries.
- If necessary, adjust the chromosome identifier and strand logic based on actual data retrieved from the initial queries.

This approach will help you identify genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands.
