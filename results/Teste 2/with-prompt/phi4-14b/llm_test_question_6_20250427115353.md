To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has, along with their names and sizes, you can follow these steps using a SQLite database that contains your GFF/GTF formatted data. Here's a walkthrough to guide you through this process:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have access to the SQLite database containing your genome annotation data. You will need Python installed with the `gffutils` library, which can interact with such databases.

```bash
pip install gffutils
```

### Step 2: Connect to the Database

Use `gffutils` to connect to your SQLite database:

```python
import gffutils

# Replace 'your_database.db' with the path to your actual database file.
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db')
```

### Step 3: Query for XIST Gene Transcripts

You need to find all transcripts associated with the XIST gene. The `attributes` field in GFF/GTF files typically contains key-value pairs, including `gene_id` and `transcript_id`.

```python
# Find the XIST gene by its gene_id or name.
xist_gene = db.features_of_type('gene', order_by='start')[0]  # Adjust if necessary to find XIST specifically.

# Extract the gene ID from attributes.
gene_id = xist_gene.attributes['gene_id'][0]

# Query for all transcripts associated with this gene.
transcripts = [t for t in db.children(xist_gene, featuretype='transcript', order_by='start')]
```

### Step 4: Calculate Transcript Sizes

For each transcript, calculate its size by summing the lengths of its exons. You can use `db.children()` to get exon features.

```python
def calculate_transcript_size(transcript):
    # Get all exons for this transcript.
    exons = db.children(transcript, featuretype='exon', order_by='start')
    
    # Calculate total size by summing the lengths of each exon.
    return sum(e.end - e.start + 1 for e in exons)

# Prepare a list to store results.
transcript_info = []

for transcript in transcripts:
    transcript_id = transcript.attributes['transcript_id'][0]
    transcript_name = transcript.attributes.get('gene_name', [''])[0] or transcript_id
    size = calculate_transcript_size(transcript)
    
    # Append the transcript name and size to the list.
    transcript_info.append((transcript_name, size))
```

### Step 5: Output Results

Print out the number of isoforms along with their names and sizes.

```python
# Print the total number of transcripts.
print(f"Number of XIST gene transcript isoforms: {len(transcripts)}")

# Print each transcript's name and size.
for name, size in transcript_info:
    print(f"Transcript Name: {name}, Size: {size}")
```

### Summary

This script connects to your SQLite database, queries for the XIST gene, retrieves all associated transcripts, calculates their sizes by summing exon lengths, and prints out each transcript's name and size. Adjust the query logic if necessary to ensure you're specifically targeting the XIST gene based on its attributes in your dataset.
