To determine how many miRNA genes are present on chromosome 10 using your GFF/GTF formatted data stored in an SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   Use a Python library like `sqlite3` or `gffutils` to connect to your SQLite database.

2. **Query for miRNA Genes on Chromosome 10:**
   You need to filter genes based on two criteria:
   - The gene must be of type "gene".
   - The gene's biotype should be "miRNA".
   - The chromosome (seqid) should be "10".

3. **SQL Query Construction:**
   Construct an SQL query that selects the count of distinct `gene_id` entries from the `features` table where:
   - `featuretype = 'gene'`
   - `attributes` contains `"gene_biotype \"miRNA\""`
   - `seqid = '10'`

4. **Execute the Query:**
   Use your database connection to execute this query and fetch the result.

### Example Code

Here's an example using Python with `sqlite3`:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# SQL query to count miRNA genes on chromosome 10
query = """
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT attributes)
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
AND seqid = '10'
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "miRNA"%';
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
- **SQL Query:** The query filters for entries where:
  - `featuretype` is 'gene'.
  - `seqid` is '10' (chromosome 10).
  - `attributes` contains the string `"gene_biotype \"miRNA\""` indicating miRNA biotype.
- **Counting Distinct Genes:** We use `COUNT(DISTINCT attributes)` to ensure we count each gene only once, as multiple entries might exist for different transcripts of the same gene.

### Considerations

- Ensure your database path is correct when connecting.
- The query assumes that `attributes` are stored in a format where you can search for specific key-value pairs like `"gene_biotype \"miRNA\""`.

This approach will give you the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 based on the provided schema and data structure.
