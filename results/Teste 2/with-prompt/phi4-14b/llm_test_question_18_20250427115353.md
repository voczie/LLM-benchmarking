To generate a stacked bar plot representing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Query the Database

First, we need to extract the necessary data from the SQLite database. We will count the number of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes for each chromosome.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' THEN 1 END) AS protein_coding_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 END) AS lncRNA_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 END) AS miRNA_count
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene'
GROUP BY 
    seqid;
```

### Step 2: Execute the Query

You can execute this query using Python with the `sqlite3` library. Here's a sample code snippet:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')

# Execute the SQL query
query = """
SELECT 
    seqid AS chromosome,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' THEN 1 END) AS protein_coding_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 END) AS lncRNA_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 END) AS miRNA_count
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene'
GROUP BY 
    seqid;
"""

# Load the query results into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Prepare Data for Plotting

Ensure that your data is in a format suitable for plotting. You might want to normalize the counts to get proportions:

```python
# Calculate total genes per chromosome
df['total_genes'] = df[['protein_coding_count', 'lncRNA_count', 'miRNA_count']].sum(axis=1)

# Calculate proportions
df['protein_coding_prop'] = df['protein_coding_count'] / df['total_genes']
df['lncRNA_prop'] = df['lncRNA_count'] / df['total_genes']
df['miRNA_prop'] = df['miRNA_count'] / df['total_genes']

# Drop the count columns if not needed
df.drop(columns=['protein_coding_count', 'lncRNA_count', 'miRNA_count', 'total_genes'], inplace=True)
```

### Step 4: Plot the Data

Use a plotting library like `matplotlib` to create the stacked bar plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set up the figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Create the stacked bar plot
df.set_index('chromosome')[['protein_coding_prop', 'lncRNA_prop', 'miRNA_prop']].plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, ax=ax)

# Add labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('Chromosome')
ax.set_ylabel('Proportion of Genes')
ax.set_title('Proportions of Protein-Coding, lncRNA, and miRNA Genes per Chromosome')

# Display the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Summary

This process involves querying the database to get counts of different gene biotypes per chromosome, calculating proportions, and then plotting these proportions using a stacked bar chart. Adjust file paths and ensure your environment has necessary libraries installed (`sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
