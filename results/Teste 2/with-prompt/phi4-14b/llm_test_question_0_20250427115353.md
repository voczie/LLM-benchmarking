To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps. We'll use SQL queries to extract this information from the `features` table.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   First, ensure that you have a connection to your SQLite database. You can use Python's `sqlite3` library for this purpose.

2. **Query for Genes on Chromosome 3:**
   We need to count entries in the `features` table where the `featuretype` is "gene" and the `seqid` (chromosome identifier) is "3".

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '3';
   ```

3. **Query for Transcripts on Chromosome 3:**
   Similarly, count entries where the `featuretype` is "transcript" and the `seqid` is "3".

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = '3';
   ```

4. **Execute Queries Using Python (Optional):**
   If you prefer to execute these queries using Python, here's a sample script:

   ```python
   import sqlite3

   # Connect to the database
   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   # Query for genes on chromosome 3
   gene_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '3';"
   cursor.execute(gene_query)
   gene_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
   print(f"Number of genes on chromosome 3: {gene_count}")

   # Query for transcripts on chromosome 3
   transcript_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = '3';"
   cursor.execute(transcript_query)
   transcript_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
   print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: {transcript_count}")

   # Close the connection
   conn.close()
   ```

### Explanation

- **`features` Table:** This table contains all genomic features, including genes and transcripts. Each row represents a feature with attributes like `featuretype`, `seqid`, etc.
  
- **`featuretype`:** Specifies the type of feature (e.g., gene, transcript).

- **`seqid`:** Represents the chromosome identifier. For human chromosomes, this is typically a number or letter (e.g., "3" for chromosome 3).

By executing these queries, you will obtain the count of genes and transcripts specifically located on chromosome 3 in your dataset. Adjust the database connection string (`'your_database.db'`) to match your actual database file path.
