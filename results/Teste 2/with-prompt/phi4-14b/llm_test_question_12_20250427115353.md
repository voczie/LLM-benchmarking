To find the two genes located immediately before and after the gene `COL1A2` in a human genome annotation stored in a SQLite database using GFF/GTF format, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the Position of COL1A2:**
   - First, retrieve the start position of the gene `COL1A2`. This will help us determine which genes are immediately before and after it.

2. **Find Genes Before COL1A2:**
   - Query for genes on the same chromosome (`seqid`) as `COL1A2` that end before the start of `COL1A2`.
   - Sort these genes by their end position in descending order to get the closest one(s) before `COL1A2`.

3. **Find Genes After COL1A2:**
   - Query for genes on the same chromosome as `COL1A2` that start after the end of `COL1A2`.
   - Sort these genes by their start position in ascending order to get the closest one(s) after `COL1A2`.

4. **Extract Gene Names:**
   - Use the attributes field to extract gene names from the results.

### SQL Queries

#### 1. Retrieve Start and End of COL1A2
```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "COL1A2"%';
```

#### 2. Find Genes Before COL1A2
Assuming `seqid`, `start_col1a2` are obtained from the first query:
```sql
SELECT f.seqid, f.start, f.end, 
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11,
              INSTR(f.attributes, '"', INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11) - 
              (INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11)) AS gene_name
FROM features f
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' 
AND f.seqid = ? -- seqid from COL1A2 query
AND f.end < ?    -- start_col1a2 from COL1A2 query
ORDER BY f.end DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

#### 3. Find Genes After COL1A2
Assuming `seqid`, `end_col1a2` are obtained from the first query:
```sql
SELECT f.seqid, f.start, f.end, 
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11,
              INSTR(f.attributes, '"', INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11) - 
              (INSTR(f.attributes, 'gene_name "') + 11)) AS gene_name
FROM features f
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' 
AND f.seqid = ? -- seqid from COL1A2 query
AND f.start > ?  -- end_col1a2 from COL1A2 query
ORDER BY f.start ASC
LIMIT 2;
```

### Explanation

- **Attributes Parsing:** The `SUBSTR` and `INSTR` functions are used to extract the gene name from the attributes field. This assumes that the attribute format is consistent with GFF/GTF standards.
  
- **Parameter Substitution:** Replace `?` with actual values obtained from the first query (i.e., `seqid`, `start_col1a2`, and `end_col1a2`).

- **Limiting Results:** The `LIMIT 2` ensures that we get up to two genes before and after, which covers cases where there might be only one gene in either direction.

### Execution

Execute these queries using a SQLite client or within a Python script using the `sqlite3` library. Ensure you handle any potential exceptions or edge cases, such as when `COL1A2` is at the very start or end of a chromosome.

This approach will give you the names of the two genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`.
