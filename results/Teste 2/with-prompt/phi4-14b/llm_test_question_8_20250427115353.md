To determine how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, we need to query the SQLite database using `gffutils` or directly with SQL. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure that you have `gffutils` installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip if necessary:

```bash
pip install gffutils
```

### Step 2: Load the Database

Assuming you have a SQLite database file (e.g., `genome_annotations.db`) containing the GFF/GTF data, load it using `gffutils`:

```python
import gffutils

# Create or connect to an existing database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path/to/genome_annotations.db', keep_order=True)
```

### Step 3: Query for BRCA1 Gene Transcripts and Exons

We need to find all transcripts of the BRCA1 gene and count their exons. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Find the BRCA1 gene by its gene_id
brca1_gene = db[gffutils.attributes['gene_id'] == 'ENSG00000012048']

# Iterate over each transcript related to the BRCA1 gene
for brca1 in brca1_gene:
    # Get all transcripts of the BRCA1 gene
    transcripts = db.children(brca1, featuretype='transcript', level=1)
    
    for transcript in transcripts:
        # Extract the transcript name from attributes
        transcript_name = gffutils.attributes['gene_name'][transcript]
        
        # Count exons associated with this transcript
        exon_count = len(list(db.children(transcript, featuretype='exon', level=1)))
        
        # Print the transcript name and number of exons
        print(f"Transcript: {transcript_name}, Exon Count: {exon_count}")
```

### Explanation

- **BRCA1 Gene Identification**: We identify the BRCA1 gene using its `gene_id`. The `gene_id` for BRCA1 is typically `ENSG00000012048`, but you should verify this in your specific database.
  
- **Transcript Retrieval**: For each transcript of the BRCA1 gene, we retrieve all child features that are of type 'transcript'.

- **Exon Counting**: For each transcript, we count its exons by retrieving all child features of type 'exon'.

- **Output**: We print the name of each transcript and the number of exons it contains.

### Alternative: Using SQL

If you prefer using raw SQL queries, here's how you can achieve the same result:

```sql
SELECT 
    t.attributes->'transcript_name' AS transcript_name,
    COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM 
    features t
JOIN 
    relations r ON t.id = r.child
JOIN 
    features e ON r.parent = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
WHERE 
    t.featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM features g WHERE g.featuretype = 'gene' AND g.attributes->'gene_id' = 'ENSG00000012048' AND g.id = r.parent
    )
GROUP BY 
    t.attributes->'transcript_name';
```

### Explanation

- **Joins**: We join the `features` table with itself using the `relations` table to link transcripts and their exons.

- **Filtering**: We filter for transcripts of the BRCA1 gene by checking if they are children of the BRCA1 gene feature.

- **Aggregation**: We group by transcript name and count the number of associated exons.

This approach will give you a list of all transcript isoforms of the BRCA1 gene along with their exon counts. Adjust the `gene_id` as necessary based on your database's specific annotations.
