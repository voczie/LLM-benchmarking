To calculate the sizes of each specified gene locus (XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, COL1A2, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB) separately using a GFF/GTF formatted database stored in SQLite3, you need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Understand the Database Schema**

The schema provided includes several tables:
- `features`: Contains genomic features with attributes like `seqid`, `featuretype`, `start`, `end`, and `attributes`.
- `relations`: Defines relationships between features, such as parent-child (gene-transcript) relationships.
- Other tables (`meta`, `directives`, `autoincrements`, `duplicates`) are not directly relevant for this task.

#### 2. **Identify Gene Features**

Gene loci sizes can be calculated by identifying the genomic range covered by each gene. This involves:
- Finding all features of type `gene` with the specified names.
- Using the `start` and `end` positions to determine the locus size.

#### 3. **Query the Database**

You will use SQL queries to extract the necessary information from the database. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```sql
-- Step 1: Extract gene features for the specified genes
SELECT f.id, f.seqid, f.start, f.end
FROM features AS f
JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%XIST";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%MALAT1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%BRCA1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%COL1A2";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%NFKB1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%NFKB2";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%REL";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%RELA";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%RELB";%'
)
AND f.featuretype IN ('gene', 'transcript');

-- Step 2: Calculate the size of each gene locus
SELECT 
    r.parent AS gene_id,
    MIN(f.start) AS min_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS max_end,
    (MAX(f.end) - MIN(f.start)) + 1 AS locus_size
FROM features AS f
JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%XIST";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%MALAT1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%BRCA1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%COL1A2";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%NFKB1";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%NFKB2";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%REL";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%RELA";%'
    UNION
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "%RELB";%'
)
GROUP BY r.parent;
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: The first query retrieves all relevant `gene` and `transcript` features for the specified genes. It uses the `relations` table to link transcripts back to their parent gene.
  
- **Step 2**: This query calculates the size of each gene locus by finding the minimum start position and maximum end position across all associated features (genes and transcripts). The locus size is computed as `(max_end - min_start) + 1`.

### Execution

To execute these queries, you can use a SQLite3 client or integrate them into a Python script using libraries like `sqlite3` or `gffutils`. Ensure your database connection is correctly set up before running the queries.

This approach will give you the size of each specified gene locus in base pairs.
