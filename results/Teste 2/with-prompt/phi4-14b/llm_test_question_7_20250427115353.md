To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using a GFF/GTF formatted database stored in SQLite, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Database Schema:**
   - The `features` table contains genomic features such as genes and exons.
   - Each feature is identified by its type (e.g., gene, exon) and associated attributes.

2. **Identify Relevant Attributes:**
   - For GTF/GFF files, the `attributes` column typically includes key-value pairs like `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, etc.
   - You need to filter features where `featuretype = 'exon'`.

3. **Locate the XIST Gene:**
   - Use the `features` table to find entries with `featuretype = 'gene'`.
   - Extract the `attributes` column and parse it to find entries where `gene_id` or `gene_name` is "XIST".

4. **Count Exons for the XIST Gene:**
   - Once you have identified the gene ID(s) associated with XIST, filter the `features` table again for exons.
   - Use a relation between genes and their exons to ensure you are counting only those exons that belong to the XIST gene.

### SQL Query

Here's how you can construct an SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find the gene_id(s) associated with the XIST gene
WITH xist_gene AS (
    SELECT id
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
      AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "XIST";%'
),

-- Step 2: Use the relations table to find all exons related to the XIST gene
xist_exons AS (
    SELECT child
    FROM relations
    JOIN xist_gene ON relations.parent = xist_gene.id
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
)

-- Step 3: Count the number of unique exons for the XIST gene
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS exon_count
FROM features
WHERE id IN (SELECT child FROM xist_exons);
```

### Explanation

- **CTE `xist_gene`:** This common table expression identifies all entries in the `features` table where the feature type is 'gene' and the attributes include `gene_name "XIST";`.
  
- **CTE `xist_exons`:** This uses the `relations` table to find all exons (`featuretype = 'exon'`) that are related to the XIST gene identified in the previous step.

- **Final Query:** Counts distinct exon IDs from the `features` table that match those found in `xist_exons`.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure your database is correctly indexed for performance, especially if dealing with large datasets.
- Adjust attribute parsing if your GTF/GFF format uses different conventions or additional attributes.

This approach will give you the number of exons associated with the XIST gene using the relational structure provided by the `relations` table.
