To determine the chromosomes where the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB are located using a GFF/GTF formatted database stored in SQLite3, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Database Schema:**
   - The `features` table contains all genomic features including genes.
   - Each feature has attributes such as `seqid` (chromosome identifier), and `attributes` which include gene identifiers like `gene_id`.

2. **Identify Relevant Features:**
   - You need to filter for features of type `gene`.
   - Extract the chromosome (`seqid`) where each gene is located.

3. **Extract Gene Information from Attributes:**
   - The `attributes` column in the `features` table contains key-value pairs, including `gene_id`. This needs parsing to extract specific genes.

4. **Query Construction:**
   - Use SQL to select features of type `gene`.
   - Parse the `attributes` field to filter for the specified gene IDs.
   - Group by chromosome (`seqid`) to determine where each gene is located.

### Example Query

Here's how you can construct an SQL query to find out on which chromosomes these genes are located:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.seqid, g.gene_id
FROM features AS f
JOIN (
    SELECT id, attributes
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
) AS g ON f.id = g.id
WHERE g.attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB1";%' 
   OR g.attributes LIKE '%gene_id "NFKB2";%'
   OR g.attributes LIKE '%gene_id "REL";%'
   OR g.attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELA";%'
   OR g.attributes LIKE '%gene_id "RELB";%'
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT DISTINCT f.seqid, g.gene_id:** This selects unique combinations of chromosome identifiers and gene IDs.
  
- **FROM features AS f JOIN (SELECT id, attributes FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene') AS g ON f.id = g.id:** 
  - The subquery filters the `features` table to include only rows where `featuretype` is `gene`.
  - It joins back to the main `features` table to get additional details like `seqid`.

- **WHERE clause with LIKE conditions:**
  - Filters for genes by checking if their `attributes` contain specific `gene_id` values.
  - The `%` wildcard allows matching any text before or after the specified gene ID.

### Running the Query

1. Connect to your SQLite3 database using a tool like `sqlite3`, Python's `sqlite3` module, or any other SQL client that supports SQLite.

2. Execute the query above to retrieve the chromosomes for each of the specified genes.

3. Review the output to see which chromosome each gene is located on.

This approach efficiently uses SQL to parse and filter genomic data stored in a structured format, leveraging the power of relational databases for complex queries.
