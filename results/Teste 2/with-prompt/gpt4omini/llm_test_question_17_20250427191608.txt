To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite database** that contains the genomic annotations.
2. **Fetch the gene features** specifically for the X chromosome.
3. **Calculate the real sizes of the genes** by summing the sizes of their unique exons.
4. **Plot the gene sizes** using a scatterplot.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Connect to the SQLite database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
db = gffutils.FeatureDB(db_path)

# Step 2: Fetch gene features for the X chromosome
genes_x = db.features_of_type('gene', seqid='X')

# Step 3: Calculate the real sizes of the genes
gene_sizes = []
for gene in genes_x:
    # Get all unique exons for the gene
    exons = list(db.children(gene, featuretype='exon', order_by='start'))
    
    # Calculate the size of each unique exon
    unique_exon_sizes = {exon.id: (exon.end - exon.start) for exon in exons}
    
    # Calculate the total gene size as the sum of unique exon sizes
    total_gene_size = sum(unique_exon_sizes.values())
    gene_sizes.append(total_gene_size)

# Step 4: Generate a scatterplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(range(len(gene_sizes)), gene_sizes, alpha=0.6)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on the X Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Gene Index')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection:** The script connects to the SQLite database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`.
- **Fetching Genes:** It retrieves all gene features located on the X chromosome using `db.features_of_type('gene', seqid='X')`.
- **Calculating Gene Sizes:** For each gene, it fetches its child exons, calculates the size of each unique exon, and sums these sizes to get the total gene size.
- **Plotting:** Finally, it uses `matplotlib` to create a scatterplot of the gene sizes.

### Requirements:
- Ensure you have the `gffutils` and `matplotlib` libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't done so:
  ```bash
  pip install gffutils matplotlib
  ```

### Note:
- Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
- The scatterplot will show the distribution of gene sizes, with each point representing a gene on the X chromosome.
