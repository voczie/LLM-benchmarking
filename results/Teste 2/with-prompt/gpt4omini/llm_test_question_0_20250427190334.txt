To answer the question of how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: First, you need to connect to the SQLite database that contains the genomic annotations.

2. **Fetch Features**: Use the `features_of_type()` method to retrieve the genes and transcripts specifically for chromosome 3.

3. **Count the Features**: Count the number of unique genes and transcripts.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Fetch genes and transcripts on chromosome 3
chromosome = '3'
genes = list(db.features_of_type('gene', seqid=chromosome))
transcripts = list(db.features_of_type('transcript', seqid=chromosome))

# Count the number of unique genes and transcripts
num_genes = len(genes)
num_transcripts = len(transcripts)

# Output the results
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome {chromosome}: {num_genes}")
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome {chromosome}: {num_transcripts}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Import the Library**: The script starts by importing the `gffutils` library.
- **Connect to the Database**: Replace `'your_database.db'` with the path to your actual database file.
- **Fetch Features**: The `features_of_type()` method is used to get all genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.
- **Count Features**: The lengths of the lists containing genes and transcripts are calculated to get the counts.
- **Print Results**: Finally, the results are printed to the console.

### Note:
Make sure you have the `gffutils` library installed and that your database is correctly set up with the appropriate annotations. Adjust the `seqid` parameter if your chromosome naming convention differs.
