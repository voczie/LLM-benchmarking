To find the genes located between the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes on both the + and - strands, we can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the database**: Use `gffutils` to connect to the SQLite database containing the genomic annotations.
2. **Fetch the coordinates of HOXC11 and HOXC12**: Retrieve the start and end coordinates of these genes.
3. **Identify the strand**: Determine the strand of both HOXC11 and HOXC12.
4. **Query for genes between the two**: Depending on the strand, query for genes that fall within the range defined by the start and end coordinates of HOXC11 and HOXC12.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Fetch HOXC11 and HOXC12 features
hoxc11 = db.features_of_type('gene', filter={'gene_id': 'HOXC11'}).next()
hoxc12 = db.features_of_type('gene', filter={'gene_id': 'HOXC12'}).next()

# Extract coordinates and strand information
hoxc11_start = hoxc11.start
hoxc11_end = hoxc11.end
hoxc11_strand = hoxc11.strand

hoxc12_start = hoxc12.start
hoxc12_end = hoxc12.end
hoxc12_strand = hoxc12.strand

# Determine the range for querying
if hoxc11_strand == '+':
    start_range = hoxc11_end
    end_range = hoxc12_start
else:
    start_range = hoxc12_end
    end_range = hoxc11_start

# Fetch genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12
genes_between = db.features_of_type('gene', 
                                     filter={'seqid': hoxc11.seqid, 
                                             'start': (start_range, end_range), 
                                             'end': (start_range, end_range)})

# Collect results
results = []
for gene in genes_between:
    results.append((gene.attributes['gene_id'][0], gene.start, gene.end, gene.strand))

# Print results
print("Genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12:")
print("|Gene_ID|Start|End|Strand|")
for gene_id, start, end, strand in results:
    print(f"|{gene_id}|{start}|{end}|{strand}|")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The script connects to the SQLite database using `gffutils.FeatureDB`.
- **Feature Retrieval**: It retrieves the features for HOXC11 and HOXC12 using their gene IDs.
- **Coordinate Extraction**: The start and end coordinates, along with the strand information, are extracted.
- **Range Determination**: Depending on the strand of HOXC11, it sets the appropriate range for querying.
- **Gene Querying**: It queries for genes that fall within the specified range on the same chromosome.
- **Results Collection**: The results are collected and printed in a formatted table.

### Note:
- Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file.
- Ensure that the gene IDs used in the filter match the format in your database.
