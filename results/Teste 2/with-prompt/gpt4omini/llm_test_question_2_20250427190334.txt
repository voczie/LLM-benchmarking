To count the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the database**: Use `gffutils.FeatureDB()` to connect to your SQLite database that contains the genomic annotations.

2. **Fetch lncRNA genes**: Use the `db.features_of_type()` method to retrieve features of type 'gene' and filter them based on the `gene_biotype` attribute to find lncRNA genes.

3. **Count the unique lncRNA genes**: Use a set to ensure that you count each unique lncRNA gene only once.

Here is a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Define the chromosome of interest
chromosome = '7'

# Fetch lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
lncRNA_genes = set()
for gene in db.features_of_type('gene', seqid=chromosome):
    # Check if the gene is an lncRNA
    if 'gene_biotype' in gene.attributes and gene.attributes['gene_biotype'][0] == 'lncRNA':
        lncRNA_genes.add(gene.id)

# Count the number of unique lncRNA genes
lncRNA_count = len(lncRNA_genes)

# Output the result
print(f'The number of lncRNA genes on chromosome {chromosome} is: {lncRNA_count}')
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
- **Feature Retrieval**: The script retrieves all genes on chromosome 7 and checks if their `gene_biotype` is 'lncRNA'.
- **Unique Counting**: A set is used to store unique gene IDs, ensuring that duplicates are not counted.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of lncRNA genes found on chromosome 7.

Make sure you have the `gffutils` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so:

```bash
pip install gffutils
```

Run the script, and it will provide you with the count of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7.
