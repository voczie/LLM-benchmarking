To calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: First, you need to connect to your SQLite database that contains the genomic annotations.

2. **Fetch Exons for BRCA1**: Retrieve all exons associated with the BRCA1 transcript isoforms.

3. **Calculate Exon Sizes**: For each exon, calculate its size using the formula `exon_size = end - start`.

4. **Compute the Average Size**: Sum the exon sizes and divide by the number of exons to get the average size.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that implements these steps:

```python
import gffutils

# Step 1: Connect to the database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Step 2: Fetch all BRCA1 transcript isoforms
brca1_transcripts = db.features_of_type('transcript', filter={'gene_id': 'BRCA1'})

# Step 3: Initialize a list to store exon sizes
exon_sizes = []

# Step 4: Iterate through each BRCA1 transcript and fetch its exons
for transcript in brca1_transcripts:
    # Fetch exons for the current transcript
    exons = db.children(transcript.id, featuretype='exon', order_by='start')
    
    # Calculate exon sizes and append to the list
    for exon in exons:
        exon_size = exon.end - exon.start
        exon_sizes.append(exon_size)

# Step 5: Calculate the average exon size
if exon_sizes:
    average_exon_size = sum(exon_sizes) / len(exon_sizes)
    print(f"The average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms is: {average_exon_size:.2f} base pairs.")
else:
    print("No exons found for BRCA1 transcript isoforms.")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database.
- **Fetching Transcripts**: The `features_of_type` method retrieves all transcript features associated with the BRCA1 gene.
- **Calculating Sizes**: For each exon, the size is calculated and stored in the `exon_sizes` list.
- **Average Calculation**: Finally, the average size is computed and printed.

### Note:
Make sure that the `gene_id` for BRCA1 matches the attribute used in your database. If the attribute name is different, adjust the filter accordingly.
