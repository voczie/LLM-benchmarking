To answer the question about how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, we can use the `gffutils` library to interact with the SQLite database containing the genomic annotations. Below is a Python script that performs the required analysis:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Define the gene of interest
gene_name = 'BRCA1'

# Fetch the gene feature for BRCA1
gene = db.features_of_type('gene', filter={'gene_id': gene_name})

# Initialize a dictionary to store transcript isoforms and their exon counts
transcript_exon_counts = {}

# Iterate through the gene features
for g in gene:
    # Fetch all transcript features associated with the gene
    transcripts = db.children(g.id, featuretype='transcript', order_by='start')
    
    for transcript in transcripts:
        # Count the number of exons for each transcript
        exons = list(db.children(transcript.id, featuretype='exon'))
        exon_count = len(exons)
        
        # Store the transcript name and its exon count
        transcript_exon_counts[transcript.attributes['transcript_id'][0]] = exon_count

# Print the results
print("Transcript Isoform Name | Number of Exons")
for transcript_id, exon_count in transcript_exon_counts.items():
    print(f"{transcript_id} | {exon_count}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Database Connection**: The script connects to the SQLite database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`. Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.

2. **Gene Retrieval**: It retrieves the gene feature for BRCA1 using `db.features_of_type()` with a filter for the `gene_id`.

3. **Transcript and Exon Counting**: For each transcript associated with the BRCA1 gene, it counts the number of exons by fetching all exon features that are children of the transcript.

4. **Storing Results**: The results are stored in a dictionary where the keys are transcript IDs and the values are the corresponding exon counts.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the transcript isoform names along with their respective number of exons in a formatted table.

### Note:
- Ensure that the `gene_id` used in the filter matches the attribute name in your GFF/GTF file. If the attribute name is different (e.g., `gene_name`), adjust the filter accordingly.
- If you need to run this code, make sure you have the `gffutils` library installed and your database properly set up.
