To count the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: First, you need to connect to the SQLite database that contains your genomic annotations.

2. **Fetch Features**: Use the `features_of_type()` method to retrieve all features of type `gene` that are located on chromosome 12.

3. **Filter by Gene Biotype**: Filter these genes to count only those that are classified as protein-coding.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Define the chromosome of interest
chromosome = '12'

# Count protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
protein_coding_genes = sum(1 for gene in db.features_of_type('gene', seqid=chromosome) 
                            if 'gene_biotype' in gene.attributes and 
                            gene.attributes['gene_biotype'][0] == 'protein_coding')

# Output the result
print(f'The number of protein-coding genes on chromosome {chromosome}: {protein_coding_genes}')
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Import the Library**: The script starts by importing the `gffutils` library.
- **Connect to the Database**: It connects to the SQLite database file named `your_database.db`. Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.
- **Define the Chromosome**: The variable `chromosome` is set to `'12'`, which is the chromosome of interest.
- **Count Protein-Coding Genes**: A generator expression is used to iterate over all gene features on chromosome 12. It checks if the `gene_biotype` attribute exists and if its value is `'protein_coding'`. The `sum()` function counts the number of such genes.
- **Output the Result**: Finally, it prints the count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

### Note:
Make sure that the attribute names (like `gene_biotype`) match those in your GFF/GTF file, as they can vary between different annotation sources. Adjust the attribute checks accordingly if needed.
