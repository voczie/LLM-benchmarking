To determine how many genes for miRNA exist on chromosome 10 using the `gffutils` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: First, you need to connect to the SQLite database that contains your genomic annotations.

2. **Fetch Features**: Use the `features_of_type()` method to retrieve features of type `gene` and filter them based on the `gene_biotype` attribute to find those that correspond to miRNA.

3. **Count the Genes**: Finally, count the number of unique genes that match the criteria.

Hereâ€™s a Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Define the chromosome of interest
chromosome = '10'

# Fetch miRNA genes on chromosome 10
miRNA_genes = db.features_of_type('gene', filter=lambda f: f.attributes.get('gene_biotype', [''])[0] == 'miRNA' and f.seqid == chromosome)

# Count the unique miRNA genes
miRNA_gene_count = len(set(g.attributes['gene_id'][0] for g in miRNA_genes))

# Print the result
print(f'The number of miRNA genes on chromosome {chromosome} is: {miRNA_gene_count}')
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The script connects to the SQLite database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`.
- **Feature Retrieval**: It retrieves features of type `gene` and filters them to include only those with a `gene_biotype` of `miRNA` on chromosome 10.
- **Counting Unique Genes**: It uses a set comprehension to ensure that only unique gene IDs are counted.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of miRNA genes found on the specified chromosome.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
- Ensure that the `gene_biotype` attribute is correctly named as per your GFF/GTF file specifications. If it differs, adjust the attribute name accordingly.
