Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the number of exons for each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that in genomic annotations, each gene can have multiple transcripts, and each transcript can consist of several exons. So, my goal is to find all the transcripts associated with BRCA1 and then count their exons.

I remember from the provided code structure tips that using SQL queries with generator expressions or list comprehensions might be efficient. Also, I should consider how to join tables if necessary.

Looking at the schema, there's a 'features' table which includes information about genes, transcripts, etc., each having an 'id'. The 'transcript_id' would be unique per transcript. So, I can query the 'features' table where the feature type is 'transcript' and the id starts with 'BRCA1'.

Once I have all the transcripts for BRCA1, I need to find their exons. Each exon in the features table has an 'id', which might be something like 'exon_XY_Z'. So, I can group these exons by transcript_id.

Wait, but how do I get the count of exons per transcript? Maybe I can use a subquery or a join to link transcripts and their exons. Alternatively, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) could help structure this query more clearly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Identify all transcripts for BRCA1.
2. For each transcript, count the number of exons it contains.

So, I can write a SELECT statement that selects the 'transcript_id' from the features table where featuretype is 'transcript' and id starts with 'BRCA1'. Then, group these by 'transcript_id' to get all transcripts.

Next, for each transcript, I need to count its exons. Each exon has an 'id', so perhaps I can select the count of distinct exons per transcript. But wait, in the features table, is there a separate column for exons? Or are they included under the general 'id'?

Looking back at the schema, the 'features' table includes attributes which might contain exon information if it's structured that way. Alternatively, perhaps each feature has an 'id', and within that, whether it's an exon.

Wait, in GFF format, exons are typically marked with a strand of '+' or '-', but I'm not sure how the database stores them. Maybe there's no separate table for exons; instead, they're included under the general features.

So, perhaps each transcript has multiple 'exon' entries within its feature record. Therefore, to count the number of exons per transcript, I can select all the 'id's where type is 'exon' and group by 'transcript_id'.

Putting this together, I might need a query that first selects all transcripts for BRCA1, then counts their exons.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an attribute in the features table indicating whether it's an exon. But without knowing the exact structure beyond what's provided, I'll proceed with the assumption that 'id' includes exon information.

So, my plan is:

- Use a subquery to get all transcripts for BRCA1.
- For each transcript, count how many exons they have by selecting their 'id's where type is 'exon'.

Wait, but in SQL, counting distinct IDs might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the number of exons can be derived from other attributes.

Alternatively, maybe I should write a query that joins the features table with itself on transcript_id to get exon information and then count them.

But considering efficiency, it's better to group by 'transcript_id' first and then count the exons within each group.

So, perhaps:

SELECT
    t.transcript_id,
    COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM
    features t
JOIN
    features e ON t.id = e.id AND t.featuretype = 'exon'
GROUP BY
    t.transcript_id;

But wait, this might not be correct because each feature can have multiple exons. So, perhaps the join isn't necessary if I can group by transcript and count all exon ids.

Alternatively, maybe using a subquery to get all exons for each transcript:

SELECT
    t.transcript_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS exon_count
FROM
    features t
WHERE
    t.featuretype = 'transcript' AND t.id LIKE 'BRCA1%'
GROUP BY
    t.transcript_id;

This way, I'm grouping all transcripts starting with BRCA1 and counting the distinct exons each has.

But wait, in this case, if a transcript has multiple exons, they would be under different 'id's. So, for each transcript, I can count how many unique exon 'id's exist.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, putting it all together, my SQL query should:

1. Select the transcript_id from features where featuretype is 'transcript' and id starts with 'BRCA1'.
2. For each of these transcripts, count the number of distinct exons (each exon has an id).

I think this approach will work.

Now, considering that in the database, the 'id's might be unique per feature type, so for a transcript, all its exons would have their own 'id's under the same 'transcript_id'.

Therefore, using COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) should give me the number of exons per transcript.

I think this query will solve the problem.

To determine the number of exons for each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene, we can use a SQL query that groups transcripts by their ID and counts the distinct exon IDs associated with each transcript. Here's how to do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    t.transcript_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS exon_count
FROM 
    features t
WHERE 
    t.featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
    t.id LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

**Explanation:**

- **Query Structure:** The query selects the `transcript_id` from the `features` table where the feature type is 'transcript' and the ID starts with 'BRCA1'.
  
- **Counting Exons:** For each selected transcript, it counts the number of distinct exon IDs (`e.id`) to determine how many exons are present in that transcript.

This approach efficiently groups transcripts by their ID and calculates the exon count for each, providing the desired information.
