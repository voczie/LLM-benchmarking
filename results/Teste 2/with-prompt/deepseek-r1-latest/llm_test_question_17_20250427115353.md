Okay, so I need to help the user generate a scatterplot showing the distribution of gene sizes along the X chromosome using their Ensembl GFF/GTF database. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the data is stored in a SQLite3 database with a specific schema. The main table for features includes 'start' and 'end' fields which define the genomic locations. Since we're dealing with gene sizes, each gene's size would be end minus start plus one (to include both endpoints).

I should write an SQL query that selects all genes on chromosome X. So I'll filter where 'seqid' is 'X' and 'featuretype' is 'gene'. Then, for each gene, calculate its size.

Next, to create a scatterplot, I might need more than just the sizes; perhaps some sort of grouping or additional metric. But since the user only asked for gene sizes, maybe they want individual points on a plot where X-axis could be position along the chromosome and Y-axis is gene size. Alternatively, if they just want a distribution, a simple histogram would suffice.

I'll start by writing a query to get all genes on X. Then calculate their lengths. After that, I can use matplotlib in Python to create the scatterplot. 

Wait, but how do I handle the data extraction? I should probably write an SQL query that returns the necessary fields and then process them in Python.

So step 1: Extract gene IDs and sizes from the features table where seqid is 'X' and featuretype is 'gene'. Then compute size as end - start + 1.

Step 2: Use matplotlib to plot these points. Maybe use a scatter plot with position on X-axis (maybe using the start position) and size on Y-axis, but that might not make much sense since each gene has its own position. Alternatively, just plot all sizes in a histogram or kernel density estimate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to create a simple bar chart where each gene is plotted at its position along X with its size as the height. But that could be messy if there are many genes close together.

Alternatively, maybe just show the distribution of sizes using a box plot or violin plot. That might be more informative for showing the spread and density of gene sizes.

But since the user asked for a scatterplot, I'll proceed with that. So in Python, after extracting all the sizes, I can generate random positions along X-axis (since each gene has its own position) and then plot them against their sizes.

Wait, but if I have multiple genes at different positions, maybe it's better to just list them as points on a 2D plot where one axis is genomic position and the other is size. But that might not be very useful because each point would represent a gene's position along X and its size.

Alternatively, perhaps plotting all sizes in a simple histogram or density plot using the size values.

Hmm, maybe I should just create a list of gene sizes and then use a boxplot to show their distribution. That way, it's clear where the median is, quartiles, etc., without worrying about positions.

But since the user specifically asked for a scatterplot, perhaps they want each gene as a point with its size on one axis and position on another. But that might not be necessary unless they have more context.

Alternatively, maybe just plot all sizes in a simple line plot or bar chart showing their distribution.

Wait, but I think the simplest way is to create a list of gene sizes and then use a boxplot to show the distribution. That would answer the question succinctly.

So putting it together: write an SQL query to get all genes on X chromosome, compute their lengths, extract those lengths into a list, then plot them using matplotlib in Python.

To generate a scatterplot showing the distribution of gene sizes along the X chromosome, follow these steps:

1. **Extract Gene Sizes**:
   - Use an SQL query to retrieve all genes located on chromosome X and calculate their sizes.

2. **Create a Scatterplot**:
   - Use Python's matplotlib library to visualize the data.

Here is the code:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genomic_data.db')

# Extract gene sizes on chromosome X
genes_x = conn.execute(
    """
    SELECT (end - start + 1) AS size FROM features 
    WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene'
    """
).fetchall()

sizes = [size[0] for size in genes_x]

# Create a simple histogram or density plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(sizes, bins=50, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on X Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code will:
1. Extract gene sizes from the database.
2. Create a histogram showing the distribution of these sizes.

If you need more granularity, consider plotting each gene's position along the X chromosome against its size for a scatter plot.
