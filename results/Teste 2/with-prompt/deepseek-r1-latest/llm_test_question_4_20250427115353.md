Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 using the provided database schema and SQL. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, the database has a table called 'features' which includes information about different genomic features like genes, transcripts, etc. Each feature is annotated with attributes that can help identify their type. For example, 'gene_biotype' might be 'miRNA' for miRNA genes.

I remember from the additional considerations that there are specific attributes in the GTF/GFF format. So, I should look into those. The user mentioned miRNA, which falls under non-coding RNAs. In the database schema, there's a 'gene_biotype' attribute that can help identify this.

So, my plan is to write an SQL query that selects all features where 'featuretype' is 'gene', and 'gene_biotype' is 'miRNA'. Additionally, I need to ensure that these genes are located on chromosome 10. That means the 'seqid' should be 'chr10'.

I also notice that there's a 'relations' table which might link features to each other, but for this task, it probably isn't necessary because we're just looking at individual gene entries.

Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that counts the number of such genes. The query should filter based on 'seqid' being 'chr10', 'featuretype' as 'gene', and 'gene_biotype' as 'miRNA'.

I need to make sure that the SQL syntax is correct, especially with string handling in SQLite. Using single quotes inside double quotes might be necessary if the database expects it.

So, the final query should look something like selecting COUNT(*) from features where seqid is 'chr10', featuretype is 'gene', and gene_biotype is 'miRNA'. This will give me the exact count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.

To determine how many miRNA genes exist in chromosome 10, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND 
      featuretype = 'gene' AND 
      gene_biotype = 'miRNA';
```

**Explanation:**
- `COUNT(*)` is used to count all matching records.
- `seqid = 'chr10'` filters the results to only those on chromosome 10.
- `featuretype = 'gene'` ensures we're counting genes specifically.
- `gene_biotype = 'miRNA'` filters for miRNA genes.

This query will return the number of miRNA genes located on chromosome 10.
