Okay, so I need to figure out how to print the names of the two genes located immediately before and after the gene COL1A2 using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that in genomic data, each feature is represented with specific attributes. In the provided schema, there's an 'id' field which likely holds the gene ID. So, I need to find all genes (where featuretype is 'gene') and locate COL1A2 within them.

Once I have COL1A2, I need to determine its position in the list of genes sorted by their start positions on the same chromosome. The immediate predecessor would be the gene that ends just before COL1A2 starts, and the successor would be the one that starts right after COL1A2 ends.

I should write a SQL query that retrieves all 'gene' features from the database. Then, I'll sort these genes by their start position on the same chromosome as COL1A2 to determine their order.

After sorting, I can find the gene immediately before and after COL1A2 in this ordered list. It's important to ensure that both genes are on the same chromosome as COL1A2; otherwise, they might not be adjacent in the genome but just appear next in the sorted list due to different chromosomes.

I also need to handle cases where there might be no predecessor or successor if COL1A2 is at the very beginning or end of the chromosome. In such cases, I should either return null for those positions or decide how to represent them based on the user's requirements.

Finally, once I have the gene IDs, I can extract their names and print them as required.

To find the genes immediately before and after COL1A2 in the genome, follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve all 'gene' features from the database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene';
   ```
   
2. **Sort these genes by their start position on the same chromosome as COL1A2**:
   - First, find the chromosome of COL1A2.
     ```sql
     SELECT chr FROM features WHERE id = 'COL1A2';
     ```
     Suppose COL1A2 is on chromosome 1.

   - Then, sort all genes by their start position on chromosome 1:
     ```sql
     SELECT id FROM features 
         WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '1'
         ORDER BY start;
     ```

3. **Identify the immediate predecessor and successor**:
   - Find the index of COL1A2 in this sorted list.
   - The gene before it is at index -1, and the one after is at index +1.

4. **Return their names**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM (
       SELECT id FROM features 
           WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '1'
           ORDER BY start
   ) AS ordered_genes,
       (SELECT id FROM features WHERE id = 'COL1A2') AS col1a2
   WHERE ordered_genes.start > col1a2.start - 1000; -- Adjust the range as needed
   ```

This approach ensures that you find genes physically adjacent to COL1A2 in the genome.
