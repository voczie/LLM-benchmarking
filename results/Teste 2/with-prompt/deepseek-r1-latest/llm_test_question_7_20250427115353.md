Okay, so I need to figure out how many exons the XIST gene has using the provided database schema and SQL. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that XIST is a pseudogene located on chromosome 17. Pseudogenes are non-coding RNA genes, but they can have intronic regions which might include exons. So, even though it's a pseudogene, the structure should be similar to other genes in terms of having exons.

I remember that in GFF format, each feature is represented by a record with attributes. For genes and transcripts, there are specific attributes like gene_id and transcript_id. Also, for exons, the attribute 'exon' would be present.

So, my plan is to query the database to find all features associated with XIST that have the 'exon' type. Then, I'll count how many such exons exist.

I should write a SQL query that selects from the 'features' table where the feature type is 'exon', and the gene_id matches 'XIST'. After selecting these records, I can take the count of those entries to determine the number of exons.

Wait, but what if XIST doesn't have any exons? Well, since it's a pseudogene, it might not be annotated with exons. But according to the example tasks, analyzing pseudogene subtypes is part of the user's tasks, so maybe there are exons here.

Putting it all together, I'll write a query that selects exon features for XIST and count them.

To determine how many exons the XIST gene has, we can use the provided database schema to query the relevant information. Here's a step-by-step SQL query:

1. **Identify the table**: We need to look at the 'features' table where the feature type is 'exon' and the gene_id matches 'XIST'.

2. **Write the SQL query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM features 
   WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND gene_id = 'XIST';
   ```

3. **Explanation**: This query counts all records in the 'features' table where the feature type is 'exon' and the gene_id is 'XIST'. The result will be the number of exons for XIST.

4. **Run the query**: Execute this SQL command to get the count of exons for XIST.

The final answer is obtained by running the above query, which returns the number of exons in the XIST gene based on the database data.
