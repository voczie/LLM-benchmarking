Okay, so I need to figure out how to count the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using a GFF/GTF database stored in SQLite. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the GTF format has a table called 'features' which contains all the genomic features like genes, transcripts, etc. Each feature is identified by its type, and for genes, there's an attribute called 'gene_biotype'. So, my first thought is to look into this table where the feature type is 'gene' and then check their gene_biotype.

I also need to make sure that I'm only considering chromosome 12. In the GTF format, each feature has a 'seqid' which should be 'chr12' or just '12'. Wait, no, looking at the schema provided, the 'seqid' is stored as text without any prefixes like chr. So, for chromosome 12, it's probably stored as '12'.

Next, I need to filter out non-protein-coding genes. The user mentioned protein-coding genes, so I should look for those with gene_biotype 'protein_coding'. There might be other biotypes like 'IG_C_gene' or 'IG_J_gene', which are T-cell receptors and not what we want.

So the plan is to query the 'features' table where featuretype is 'gene', seqid is '12', and gene_biotype is 'protein_coding'. Then, count how many such entries there are.

I should also consider if there are any pseudogene annotations. The schema includes a 'gene_biotype' that can be 'pseudogene', so I need to exclude those as well. So the condition becomes gene_biotype in ('protein_coding', 'processed_pseudogene')? Wait, no, because processed pseudogenes might still be considered genes but not protein-coding.

Wait, looking at the additional considerations, there are specific biotypes for pseudogenes like 'TEC' (transcribed expressed c), which I think refers to translated. So perhaps it's better to explicitly check for 'protein_coding'.

Putting this together, my SQL query should select from the features table where featuretype is 'gene', seqid is '12', and gene_biotype is 'protein_coding'. Then, count those rows.

I also need to make sure that I'm using the correct column names as per the schema. The attributes are stored in a text field, so for gene_biotype, it's directly accessible.

So the final query would be something like:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '12' AND gene_biotype = 'protein_coding';

This should give me the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.
</think>

To determine how many protein-coding genes are present on chromosome 12 in a GFF/GTF database stored in SQLite, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
    AND seqid = '12' 
    AND gene_biotype = 'protein_coding';
```

**Explanation:**
- `COUNT(*)` is used to count all matching rows.
- The query filters the `features` table for:
  - `featuretype`: 'gene' (to consider only genes)
  - `seqid`: '12' (to consider only chromosome 12)
  - `gene_biotype`: 'protein_coding' (to consider only protein-coding genes)

This query efficiently counts the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.
