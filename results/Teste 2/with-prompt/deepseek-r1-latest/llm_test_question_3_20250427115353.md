Okay, I need to figure out how to determine how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome using the provided database schema and SQL. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that pseudogenes are a type of gene, but they're usually non-functional or have lost their original function. So, in the database, there should be an attribute that indicates whether a feature is a pseudogene. Looking at the schema provided, under the 'attributes' column in the features table, there's an attribute called 'pseudogene'. That seems like the right one to use.

Next, I need to identify which chromosomes are represented as 'X' or '22' because in some databases, chromosome X is denoted by 22. So, my query should filter where seqid equals either 'X' or '22'.

I also want to count all types of pseudogenes, including protein-coding and non-protein-coding ones. The database has a 'gene_biotype' attribute which can help categorize them. For example, 'protein_coding' would be one type, but there are others like 'lncRNA', 'miRNA', etc., so I should include all possible pseudogene biotypes.

Putting this together, my SQL query will select the distinct 'pseudogene' values from the features table where seqid is either 'X' or '22'. Using DISTINCT ensures that each pseudogene is counted only once, even if it appears multiple times in different features (though I think each featuretype should be unique per id).

I also need to make sure that the query correctly accesses the attributes. The schema shows that 'pseudogene' is an attribute stored as a text field, so selecting it directly from the features table should work.

So, the final SQL query will look something like this: SELECT DISTINCT pseudogene FROM features WHERE seqid IN ('X', '22');. This should give me all unique pseudogenes on chromosome X.

To determine how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome using the provided database schema and SQL, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Pseudogenes**: Use the `pseudogene` attribute to filter for pseudogenes.

2. **Filter by Chromosome**: Since chromosome X is represented as 'X' or '22', use a condition to select features from either of these chromosomes.

3. **Count Unique Pseudogenes**: Use DISTINCT to count each unique pseudogene only once.

Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT pseudogene 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid IN ('X', '22');
```

This query will return a list of all unique pseudogenes found on chromosome X.
