Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine the chromosomes where specific genes are located using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. The user provided some code structure tips and mentioned using generator expressions or list comprehensions for efficient filtering.

First, I should understand what each gene's location looks like in the database. In GFF format, each feature is represented by a row in the features table. For genes, there are usually two entries: one for the start (gene_start) and one for the end (gene_end). These represent the beginning and end of the gene's locus on a chromosome.

So, I need to write a SQL query that selects all chromosomes where any of these genes have their start or end points. That way, even if some entries are for the start and others for the end, both will contribute to finding the correct chromosome.

I'll use a SELECT statement with DISTINCT on the seqid column because each gene's locus is defined by its start and end in different rows. By selecting all distinct seqids from these specific genes' features, I can get all the chromosomes they're located on.

Putting it together, the query will select the seqid (chromosome identifier) where any of the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, or RELB have their start or end. This should give me a list of chromosomes containing these genes.

To determine the chromosomes on which the specified genes are located, you can use a SQL query that selects distinct chromosome identifiers (`seqid`) where any of the genes have either a `start` or `end` position.

Here's how to structure your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.seqid 
FROM features f 
WHERE 
    (f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
     (f.gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' OR 
      f.gene_id IN ('NFkB1', 'NFkB2', 'RE', 'RELA', 'RELB'))) 
    OR 
    (f.start IS NULL OR f.end IS NULL);
```

**Explanation:**
- `features` table contains all gene features.
- We filter for rows where the feature is a protein-coding gene with one of the specified genes or has either start or end positions missing, which indicates it's part of a locus spanning multiple entries.

This query will return distinct chromosome identifiers (`seqid`) containing any of the specified genes.
