Okay, so I need to figure out how to find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, I know that the BRCA1 gene is a well-known tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17. But in this case, the task isn't just to confirm its location but to retrieve it programmatically from the database. So, I need to write a SQL query that can fetch the start and end positions of the BRCA1 gene.

Looking at the schema provided, there's a table called 'features' which seems to hold all the genomic features like genes, transcripts, etc. Each feature has attributes including its type (like 'gene'), start and end positions, strand, etc. So, I should focus on this 'features' table.

I remember that in GFF files, each gene is represented with a 'gene' feature type. The BRCA1 gene would be stored there. So, my query needs to select the start and end columns from the features where the featuretype is 'gene' and the id is 'BRCA1'.

Wait, but I should also consider that in some cases, genes might have pseudogene annotations or other related entries. But since the user specifically asked for BRCA1, which is a gene, not a pseudogene, it's safe to assume that there will be exactly one matching entry.

So, putting this together, my SQL query would look something like SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND id = 'BRCA1'. That should give me the genomic coordinates of BRCA1.

I also need to make sure that the database is connected and running properly. The user mentioned using SQLite3, so I can use Python's sqlite3 module to execute this query. But since the user didn't ask for code but a guide on how to approach it, I'll focus on the SQL part.

Another thing to consider: sometimes, the 'id' might not be unique if there are multiple genes with the same ID in different chromosomes or versions. But BRCA1 is a standard gene, so this shouldn't be an issue here.

I should also think about error handling, like cases where the gene isn't found. In such cases, the query would return no results, and I'd need to handle that appropriately. But since the user's question assumes the existence of BRCA1, maybe it's beyond the scope for now.

So, in summary, the key steps are:
1. Identify the correct table ('features') where genomic data is stored.
2. Use the 'gene' featuretype and 'id' field to filter the BRCA1 entry.
3. Extract start and end positions from this entry.

This should give me the chromosomal position of BRCA1 as required.

To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene, you can use a SQL query on your SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Here's how to approach it:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify the Correct Table**: The genomic data is stored in the `features` table.
2. **Understand the Attributes**: Each feature has attributes including its type (e.g., 'gene'), start and end positions, strand, etc.
3. **Filter by Feature Type and ID**: Use conditions to select only entries where `featuretype` is 'gene' and `id` is 'BRCA1'.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND 
    id = 'BRCA1';
```

This query will return the start and end positions of the BRCA1 gene on its respective chromosome.
