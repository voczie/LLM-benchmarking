Okay, so I need to figure out which strand the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located on using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that in genomic databases like Ensembl, each gene has attributes such as their name, location (start and end positions), strand, and possibly others. The user is asking about the strand for specific genes: HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12. 

I remember that the 'strand' attribute in GFF files can be '+' or '-', indicating whether the gene is on the forward or reverse strand respectively. So my goal is to retrieve these genes from the database and check their 'strand' value.

Looking at the database schema provided, there's a table called 'features' which contains all the genomic features, including genes. Each feature has an 'id', 'seqid' (which is the chromosome identifier), 'start' and 'end' positions, and a 'strand' attribute.

So I need to write a SQL query that selects the gene IDs along with their strand information from the 'features' table where the feature type is 'gene'. Then, I'll check if this list includes HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12. If they are present, I can note down their strands.

I should structure my query to select id and strand for all genes in these three gene IDs. That way, the output will clearly show each gene's location on either '+' or '-' strand.

Wait, but how do I ensure that only these specific genes are retrieved? Maybe it's better to first get all the genes with those IDs and then check their strands. Alternatively, since the user is asking about these three specifically, perhaps a simple SELECT statement targeting them would be sufficient.

I think using a WHERE clause with IN operator for the gene IDs would work best. So something like:

SELECT id, strand FROM features WHERE id IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12') AND featuretype = 'gene';

This should give me the strand information for each of these genes.

Now, considering that the database might have lowercase or mixed case IDs, but in this case, the user provided them in uppercase. I'll assume they are correctly named in the database.

Once I run this query, it will return rows with id and strand for each gene. Each row's 'strand' value will tell me whether the gene is on the forward (positive) or reverse (negative) strand.

I should also consider if any of these genes might be pseudogenes or have different strands based on their annotations. But since the query specifically targets the main gene IDs, it should return accurate results.

So in summary, my approach is to write a SELECT statement that fetches the 'id' and 'strand' for each of the specified genes from the 'features' table where the feature type is 'gene'. This will directly answer the user's question about their strand locations.

To determine the strand on which HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located in the provided SQLite database, we can use a SQL query to retrieve the relevant information from the `features` table. Here's how:

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT id, strand FROM features 
WHERE id IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12') AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT id, strand**: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the gene IDs and their respective strands.
- **FROM features**: Indicates that the data is being fetched from the `features` table in the database.
- **WHERE id IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12') AND featuretype = 'gene'**: This condition filters the results to only include the specified gene IDs and ensures we're looking at gene features.

### Output:
Running this query will return a table with two columns: `id` (the gene name) and `strand` (either '+' or '-'). Each row will indicate whether the respective gene is located on the forward strand ('+') or the reverse strand ('-') in the database.
