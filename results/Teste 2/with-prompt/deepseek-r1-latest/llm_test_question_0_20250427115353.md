Okay, so I need to figure out how to count the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 using a SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF annotations. Let me start by understanding what each part of the question is asking for.

First, counting the number of genes on chromosome 3 means I need to look through all the features in the database where the feature type is 'gene' and the sequence ID (seqid) is 'chr3'. Similarly, for transcripts, it's the same but with featuretype 'transcript'.

I remember that in SQLite, each row in a table represents one record. So I'll need to query both the features and relations tables because genes can be related to other genomic elements like exons or transcripts.

Wait, actually, looking at the schema provided, there are separate tables for features (which includes genes) and relations. The relations table might link parent and child features, but maybe it's not necessary for this count unless I'm dealing with something more complex like isoforms or alternative splicing events. Since the user just wants the total number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3, perhaps the relations table isn't needed here.

So my plan is to write two separate SQL queries: one to count the genes and another to count the transcripts on chromosome 3.

For the genes:
- I'll select all features where featuretype is 'gene' and seqid is 'chr3'.
- Then, group them by their ID (since each gene should have a unique ID) and count how many groups there are. This will give me the number of distinct genes on chr3.

Similarly, for transcripts:
- I'll select all features where featuretype is 'transcript' and seqid is 'chr3'.
- Again, group by their ID to ensure each transcript is counted once and then count them.

I should also consider that some entries might be pseudogenes or other types of genes. But since the user specifically asked for gene counts, I'll stick with featuretype 'gene'.

Wait, but in the schema, there's a relations table. Do I need to use it? Maybe if I'm counting transcripts associated with each gene, like exons or isoforms. For example, a single gene might have multiple transcripts due to alternative splicing.

But the user is just asking for the total number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3, not considering their relationships. So perhaps using relations isn't necessary here unless I'm required to link them in some way.

Alternatively, if I want to ensure that each transcript is associated with a gene, maybe I should join features and relations tables. But since the user only wants counts of genes and transcripts regardless of their relation, it might be overcomplicating things.

So sticking with the initial approach: two separate SELECT statements for genes and transcripts on chr3.

I'll write them as:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_genes FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid LIKE 'chr3%';

And similarly for transcripts:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_transcripts FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid LIKE 'chr3%';

Wait, but in the schema, the seqid is a text field. So using LIKE with 'chr3%' might not be accurate because it's case-sensitive and could match other chromosomes if they have similar names.

Looking back at the schema, the seqid can be numbers or letters like 1, chrX, etc. So perhaps I should use a string comparison instead of a wildcard. But in SQLite, comparing strings is straightforward with = operator.

So maybe it's better to filter where seqid equals 'chr3' exactly.

But wait, looking at the schema again: the seqid column is text, so it can contain any identifier, including numbers and letters. So for chromosome 3, the seqid would be 'chr3'.

Therefore, I should adjust the queries to use:

WHERE features.seqid = 'chr3'

That way, it's exact.

So updating the queries:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_genes FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'chr3';

And similarly for transcripts.

This should give me the counts accurately.

I think that covers everything. Now I can present these two SQL statements as the solution.
</think>

To determine the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3, we'll query the database using the `features` table since both genes and transcripts are represented there by their respective feature types ('gene' and 'transcript').

### Query for Counting Genes
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_genes FROM features WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'chr3';
```

### Query for Counting Transcripts
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_transcripts FROM features WHERE 
    featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = 'chr3';
```

These queries will return the counts of distinct gene and transcript IDs on chromosome 3.
