Okay, so I need to calculate the sizes of each gene locus for specific genes on chromosome 1. The user provided a GFF/GTF database structure in SQLite format, which includes tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates.

First, I should figure out how to get the start and end positions of each gene's locus. In the features table, each feature has a 'start' and 'end' field. For genes, these represent the beginning and end of the gene's span on the chromosome.

I remember that in GTF files, a gene can have multiple transcript isoforms, but for this task, I'm only interested in the gene loci, not the transcripts themselves. So each gene will be represented once per its locus.

Looking at the schema, the features table has 'seqid' which is the chromosome identifier (like chr1), 'start', and 'end'. The size of the locus would be end - start + 1 because it's inclusive of both endpoints.

I need to extract each gene by their gene_id. So I'll write a SELECT statement that selects from the features table where featuretype is 'gene' and seqid is 'chr1'. Then, group these genes by their gene_id so that if there are multiple entries for the same gene (like different isoforms), they're grouped together.

Once I have all the unique gene_ids on chromosome 1, I can calculate each locus size. For example, for a gene with start=50 and end=200, the size would be 200 - 50 + 1 = 151.

I should also consider that some genes might have their 'end' field as NULL or not present, but in this case, since we're using chr1, which is a standard chromosome, I can assume all entries are valid and have both start and end values.

Putting it all together, the SQL query will select each gene_id from features where featuretype is 'gene', seqid is 'chr1', group by gene_id, calculate the size as (end - start + 1), and then order them for clarity.

To calculate the sizes of each gene locus on chromosome 1 for the specified genes using the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    gene_id,
    (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'chr1'
GROUP BY 
    gene_id
ORDER BY 
    size DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `features` table contains the genomic features, including genes.
- `featuretype = 'gene'`: Filters for all gene entries.
- `seqid = 'chr1'`: Specifies that we're only interested in chromosome 1.
- `(end - start + 1) AS size`: Calculates the size of each gene locus. The "+1" ensures both endpoints are included.
- `GROUP BY gene_id`: Groups results by gene ID to handle any pseudogenes or alternative transcripts.
- `ORDER BY size DESC`: Orders genes from largest to smallest locus size for clarity.

**Note:** This query assumes that all entries in the database have valid start and end positions. If some records are incomplete, you might need additional checks or error handling.
