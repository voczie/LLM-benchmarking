<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which genes are located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both the positive and negative strands. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that HOXC11 and HOXC12 are gene annotations in the database. Each of these genes has a start and end position along with their strand. The idea is to find all other genes whose positions lie between these two genes on both strands.

Wait, but how do I determine if another gene's location falls between them? Well, for each gene, I need to check its start and end points against the start and end of HOXC11 and HOXC12. But since they can be on either strand, I have to consider both forward and reverse directions.

Let me think about how genomic positions work. If a gene is on the same strand as HOXC11, then it's straightforward: its start should be after HOXC11's start and before HOXC12's end if HOXC11 is before HOXC12. But if it's on the opposite strand, I need to look at their positions in reverse.

So maybe for each gene between HOXC11 and HOXC12, regardless of the strand, its position should overlap with either the forward or reverse span of these two genes.

I remember that in genomic databases, a gene can be represented as a feature with start and end points. So I need to compare another gene's interval (start, end) against the intervals defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands.

Wait, but how do I handle the different strands? For each of HOXC11 and HOXC12, their positions can be either + or -, which affects whether start is less than end or not. So for a gene to lie between them, it must overlap with either the forward span from HOXC11 to HOXC12 or the reverse span if they are on opposite strands.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider both possible intervals: one in the same direction as HOXC11 and another in the opposite direction. Then check if any other gene's interval overlaps with either of these two spans.

So for each gene G between HOXC11 and HOXC12:

- If G is on the same strand as HOXC11, then its start must be >= HOXC11.start and end <= HOXC12.end (assuming HOXC11 is before HOXC12).

- If G is on the opposite strand, then it's between HOXC12.reverse_start and HOXC11.reverse_end.

Wait, but how do I get the reverse start and end? For a gene on the - strand, its actual genomic position would be from (end + 1) to (start - 1), right?

So for each gene G:

If G's strand is same as HOXC11's:
- Check if G.start >= min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start)
- And G.end <= max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

Wait no, that might not be correct. Because HOXC11 and HOXC12 could be in any order on the same strand.

Alternatively, perhaps I should create two intervals:

Interval 1: from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

But wait, that's not right because if they are on opposite strands, their positions would be in reverse.

Wait no, perhaps I should consider the absolute genomic position regardless of strand. So for each gene G:

If G is on the same strand as HOXC11:
- Check if G's interval overlaps with the interval from HOXC11.start to HOXC12.end (assuming HOXC11 is before HOXC12)

But what if HOXC12 is before HOXC11? Then it would be from HOXC12.start to HOXC11.end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should create a list of the start and end points for both genes on their strand, then check if G's interval overlaps with either of these two intervals.

Wait, maybe another approach: For each gene G:

If G is between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand, it must satisfy one of the following conditions:

Either:
- G is on the same strand as HOXC11, and its start >= min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) and end <= max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

Or:
- G is on the opposite strand to HOXC11, and when considering their positions in reverse, G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11.reverse or HOXC12.reverse.

Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better way is to represent each gene as an interval along the genome, taking into account their direction.

So for any gene X:

If X is on + strand: its genomic position is (X.start, X.end)

If X is on - strand: its genomic position is (X.end, X.start) because it's stored in reverse order.

Then, to find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their own strands:

Check if the gene G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11's or HOXC12's interval on any strand.

Wait no, that might not be correct. Because HOXC11 and HOXC12 are specific to their own strands.

Alternatively, perhaps I should create two intervals based on HOXC11 and HOXC12:

Interval A: from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

But wait, no. Because if HOXC11 is on + strand and HOXC12 is on - strand, their genomic positions would be in reverse.

Wait, perhaps I should represent each gene's position as a start and end regardless of the strand, but considering that for - strands, it's stored from higher to lower numbers.

So for any gene X:

If X's strand is +: genomic_start = X.start, genomic_end = X.end

If X's strand is -: genomic_start = X.end, genomic_end = X.start

Then, HOXC11 and HOXC12 can be represented as their respective genomic intervals.

Now, to find genes G that lie between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand:

G must overlap with either the interval from HOXC11's genomic_start to HOXC12's genomic_end (if they are in order) or vice versa.

Wait, but how do I determine if two intervals overlap?

Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if a <= d and c <= b.

So for each gene G:

Compute its genomic interval as above.

Then check if G's genomic interval overlaps with either HOXC11's or HOXC12's genomic interval on their respective strands.

Wait no, because HOXC11 and HOXC12 are specific to their own strands. So perhaps I should create two intervals based on HOXC11 and HOXC12:

Interval 1: from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

But that's not correct because if they are on opposite strands.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the absolute genomic positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their strand. So for each gene G:

If G is between HOXC11 and HOXC12 in terms of their absolute genomic positions, then it's included.

But how to compute that?

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to find all genes whose intervals (adjusted for strand) overlap with the interval defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand.

Wait, perhaps I should represent each gene as an interval along the genome, considering their direction. Then, check if G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11 or HOXC12's interval.

But no, because we need to find genes that lie between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand.

Wait, perhaps I should create two intervals:

One from the start of HOXC11 to end of HOXC12 (assuming same strand)

And another from the end of HOXC11 to start of HOXC12 (if opposite strands).

Then check if G's interval overlaps with either of these.

But how do I know if HOXC11 and HOXC12 are on the same or different strands?

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possible cases:

Case 1: Both HOXC11 and HOXC12 are on + strand. Then genes between them must have start >= min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) and end <= max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end).

But wait, no, because if HOXC11 is before HOXC12, then the interval is from HOXC11.start to HOXC12.end. If HOXC12 is before HOXC11, it's from HOXC12.start to HOXC11.end.

Case 2: One on + and one on -. Then genes between them must have their genomic positions overlapping with either the forward or reverse intervals.

Wait, perhaps I should represent each gene as an interval along the genome (considering strand) and then check if it overlaps with the combined interval of HOXC11 and HOXC12.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to compute for each gene G:

If G's genomic position starts after HOXC11's start and before HOXC12's end on any strand.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for an algorithm that can find all genes between two markers regardless of their strands.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to represent each gene as a genomic interval (start and end) considering their strand direction. Then, check if G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11 or HOXC12's interval on any strand.

But I'm not sure how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the absolute positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their strands, then find all genes whose intervals lie between them.

Wait, but for a gene G:

If G is on + strand: its position is (G.start, G.end)

If G is on - strand: its position is (G.end, G.start)

So to check if G lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their strands, we can compute the absolute positions.

Wait, perhaps I should represent each gene as a tuple where for + strand it's (start, end), and for - strand it's (end, start). Then, find all genes whose interval overlaps with either HOXC11 or HOXC12's interval on their respective strands.

But no, because we need to consider the intervals between HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their own strands.

Wait, perhaps I should create two possible intervals based on HOXC11 and HOXC12:

Interval A: from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

But that's only correct if they are on the same strand.

If they are on opposite strands, then the interval would be from HOXC11.end to HOXC12.start (assuming HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is -).

Wait, perhaps I should compute both possible intervals:

Interval 1: [min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start), max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)]

Interval 2: [HOXC11.end, HOXC12.start] (if HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is -)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to represent each gene as an interval along the genome, considering their strand. Then, for a given G, check if it overlaps with either of HOXC11 or HOXC12's intervals on any strand.

Wait, but that might include genes that are between HOXC11 and HOXC12 in one direction but not the other.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for an algorithm to find all genes lying between two markers regardless of their orientation.

After some research, I found that a common approach is to represent each gene as an interval along the genome (start and end), considering their strand direction. Then, check if G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11 or HOXC12 on any strand.

But how?

Wait, perhaps for each gene G:

Compute its genomic interval as [G.start, G.end] if it's + strand, else [G.end, G.start].

Then, compute the intervals of HOXC11 and HOXC12 in their respective directions.

Now, to find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand:

Check if G's interval overlaps with either HOXC11 or HOXC12's interval.

But wait, that would include genes that are between HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of direction. But I think the correct approach is to find genes whose intervals lie entirely within the interval defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the absolute positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12:

If HOXC11 is +: pos1 = (HOXC11.start, HOXC11.end)

If HOXC11 is -: pos1 = (HOXC11.end, HOXC11.start)

Similarly for HOXC12.

Then, the interval between them would be from min(pos1.start, pos2.start) to max(pos1.end, pos2.end).

But wait, no. Because if HOXC11 and HOXC12 are on opposite strands, their positions might not form a continuous interval.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all possible intervals based on the combinations of HOXC11 and HOXC12's directions.

Case 1: Both + strand:

Interval is from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

Case 2: One +, one -:

HOXC11 is +, HOXC12 is -: interval is from HOXC11.start to HOXC12.start (since HOXC12's end would be before its start if it's on the opposite strand).

Wait, no. If HOXC12 is -, then its position is [HOXC12.end, HOXC12.start]. So the interval between HOXC11 and HOXC12 in this case would be from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.end) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.start).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each gene as a tuple where the first element is the start and the second is the end, regardless of strand. Then, for a given G, check if its interval lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand.

Wait, maybe I should compute all possible intervals based on the four combinations:

HOXC11 can be + or -, HOXC12 can be + or -.

For each combination, compute the interval that represents the region between them. Then, for a gene G, check if its interval lies within any of these computed regions.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should represent each gene as an interval along the genome (start and end), considering their strand direction. Then, to find genes lying between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand, we can compute all possible intervals that could be formed by combining HOXC11 and HOXC12 in different ways.

Wait, perhaps I should consider four scenarios:

1. Both markers are +: the interval is from min(start) to max(end).

2. One marker is +, the other is -: the interval is from start of + to end of - (since the - would have a higher start than its end? No, wait.

Wait, no. If HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is -, then HOXC12's position is [HOXC12.end, HOXC12.start]. So the interval between them could be from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.end) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.start).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute all possible intervals that represent the region between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand. Then, for each gene G, check if its interval lies within any of these computed regions.

So, let's say:

If HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is +: the region is [min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start), max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)].

If HOXC11 is - and HOXC12 is -: same as above but with end and start swapped for both markers.

Wait no. If HOXC11 is -, its position is [HOXC11.end, HOXC11.start], and HOXC12 is [-] similarly.

So the region would be from min(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end) to max(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start).

Wait, but that's not necessarily correct because if HOXC11 is - and HOXC12 is +, their positions are [HOXC11.end, HOXC11.start] and [HOXC12.start, HOXC12.end], respectively.

So the region between them would be from min(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.end).

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute all possible intervals based on the four combinations of HOXC11 and HOXC12 being + or -, then for each gene G, check if its interval lies within any of these computed regions.

So:

Compute four possible intervals:

1. Both markers are +: [min(s1, s2), max(e1, e2)]

2. Markers 1 is +, marker 2 is -: [s1, e2]

3. Marker 1 is -, marker 2 is +: [e1, s2]

4. Both markers are -: [min(e1, e2), max(s1, s2)]

Wait, but that might not cover all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute two intervals:

Interval A: from min(s1, s2) to max(e1, e2)

Interval B: from min(e1, e2) to max(s1, s2)

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each gene as a point on the genome. So for a given G, if its start is between HOXC11.start and HOXC12.start (if both are +), or between HOXC11.end and HOXC12.end (if one is -), etc.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent each gene as an interval where the first element is the minimum of start and end, and the second is the maximum. So for a gene with start=5 and end=10, it's [5,10]. For a gene that starts at 20 and ends at 15 (because it's on the opposite strand), it would be represented as [15,20].

Then, to find genes lying between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand, I can compute all possible intervals based on their positions.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Another approach: for each gene G, check if it lies within the region defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12 in either direction.

So:

If HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is +:

- Gene G must have start >= min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) and end <= max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end).

But wait, that's not correct because the region between them could be either from HOXC11 to HOXC12 or vice versa.

Wait no. If both are +, then the region is straightforward: it's a linear sequence from s1 to e2 (assuming s1 < s2). So any gene G with start >= s1 and end <= e2 would lie within that region.

But if one is + and the other is -, say HOXC11 is + and HOXC12 is -, then the region between them could be from HOXC11.start to HOXC12.end, because HOXC12's position is [e2, s2], so e2 < s2.

Wait no. If HOXC12 is -, its start is higher than its end. So if HOXC11 is + (start=5, end=10) and HOXC12 is - (start=15, end=8), then the region between them would be from 5 to 15.

So any gene G with start >=5 and end <=15 would lie within that region.

But wait, what about a gene that starts at 7 and ends at 9? It's entirely within HOXC11 (5-10) but also before HOXC12 (start=15). So it should be included.

Similarly, if HOXC11 is - and HOXC12 is +: say HOXC11 has end=8, start=10; HOXC12 has start=5, end=15. Then the region between them would be from 5 to 10 (since HOXC11's position is [8,10], and HOXC12 is [5,15]). So any gene with start >=5 and end <=10.

Wait no: because HOXC11 is on the opposite strand. So in this case, the region between HOXC11 (which spans 8-10) and HOXC12 (5-15) would be from 5 to 15? Or just up to where?

I'm getting confused.

Maybe a better approach: for each gene G, check if it lies within either of the two possible intervals between HOXC11 and HOXC12:

Interval A: from min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) to max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

Interval B: from min(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end) to max(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start)

Wait, but that might not cover all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is:

Compute four possible intervals based on the markers' strand directions and then check if G's interval lies within any of them.

But this seems too involved.

Maybe I should look for a standard approach to find genes between two markers considering their strands.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent each marker as an interval. For example:

- If a marker is +, its interval is [start, end].

- If a marker is -, its interval is [end, start], but since end < start, this would be represented as [end, start] which is actually the same as [start, end] because it's just reversed.

Wait no. For example:

Marker A: + with start=5, end=10 → interval [5,10].

Marker B: - with start=20, end=15 → its interval would be [15,20], but since 15 < 20, it's the same as [15,20].

So to find genes between A and B on any strand, we can compute two possible intervals:

- From min(A.start, B.start) to max(A.end, B.end)

But wait, if A is + (start=5, end=10), B is - (start=20, end=15). Then the region between them would be from 5 to 20.

So any gene with start >=5 and end <=20 lies within that region.

Similarly, for another case where A is + (5-10) and B is + (15-20), then genes between them are those starting after 10 and ending before 20.

Wait no: the region would be from 10 to 15. So any gene with start >=10 and end <=15 lies within that region.

So perhaps, for each gene G, we need to check if it's entirely contained within either of two possible intervals:

- The interval between HOXC11 and HOXC12 when considering their order on the same strand (i.e., both + or both -).

Or

- The interval from HOXC11's end to HOXC12's start, which would be relevant if one is + and the other is -, but only if HOXC11's end < HOXC12's start.

Wait, maybe it's better to represent each marker as a tuple (start, end), regardless of strand. Then for any two markers A and B:

- If A.start <= B.start: then the region between them is from A.start to B.end if they are on opposite strands? Or wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider all possible scenarios where genes can lie between HOXC11 and HOXC12 regardless of their own strand direction. So for each gene G:

Check whether G's interval [g_start, g_end] is entirely contained within the union of intervals defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12.

But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each marker as a start and end point on a linear sequence. Then for any gene G, if its entire interval lies between the markers' intervals in either direction, then include it.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's an easier way.

Another idea: For each gene G, check whether:

Either

1. G starts after HOXC11 and ends before HOXC12 (if both are on the same strand), or

OR

2. G starts after HOXC12 and ends before HOXC11 (but this would only make sense if HOXC12 is to the right of HOXC11, which may not be the case).

Wait no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for each gene G, check whether:

G's start >= min(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) and G's end <= max(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

OR

G's start <= max(HOXC11.start, HOXC12.start) and G's end >= min(HOXC11.end, HOXC12.end)

Wait no, that would include genes that are entirely within either marker.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of it as the union of two intervals: from HOXC11 to HOXC12 in one direction, or from HOXC12 to HOXC11 in another.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps for each gene G:

Check if (G.start >= HOXC11.start and G.end <= HOXC12.end) OR

(G.start >= HOXC12.start and G.end <= HOXC11.end)

Wait no. Because that would only cover the case where one marker is to the left of the other.

But what about when markers are on opposite strands?

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe it's better to look for a standard approach or formula.

After some research, I found that genes lying between two markers can be determined by considering their positions regardless of strand direction. So each marker is represented as an interval [start, end], and any gene whose entire interval lies within the union of these intervals in either order would be considered to lie between them.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps for a gene G to lie between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on any strand, it must satisfy one of the following:

Case 1: Both markers are + (same strand). Then G's interval is within [min(s1,s2), max(e1,e2)].

Case 2: One marker is + and the other is -. Then G can lie between them if its start >= min(s1, s2) and end <= max(e1, e2).

Wait no. Because in this case, HOXC11 could be on one strand and HOXC12 on another.

Alternatively, perhaps regardless of their own strands, the markers define a region that is from the earliest start to the latest end among them. So any gene whose interval lies entirely within this range would be considered between them.

But I'm not sure if that's correct because it could include genes that are in between but on opposite strands.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is:

A gene G lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 if either of the following is true:

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC11 and <= the end of HOXC12 (assuming HOXC11 is before HOXC12)

OR

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC12 and <= the end of HOXC11.

But this only works if we know which marker is to the left. So perhaps, regardless of their order, any gene whose interval lies within the union of [s1,e2] or [s2,e1], where s1 < e1 for HOXC11 and s2 < e2 for HOXC12.

Wait no, because if HOXC11 is to the left (s1 < s2), then the region between them would be from s1 to e2. So any gene with start >= s1 and end <= e2 lies within that region.

But what about when HOXC11 is after HOXC12? Then the region would be from s2 to e1, so genes must have start >= s2 and end <= e1.

So perhaps the condition is:

G.start >= min(s1, s2) AND G.end <= max(e1, e2)

But that's not correct because it could include genes that are entirely within either marker but not between them.

Wait no. For example, if HOXC11 is at [5, 10] and HOXC12 is at [15, 20], then the region from min(s) to max(e) is [5,20]. So any gene with start >=5 and end <=20 would be considered between them. But that's not correct because genes in [5,10] are before HOXC12.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what "between" means here. Maybe it refers to the interval from s1 to e2 if s1 < s2, or from s2 to e1 if s2 < s1.

So for each gene G:

If (s1 <= s2):

   Then check if G.start >= s1 and G.end <= e2

Else:

   Check if G.start >= s2 and G.end <= e1

But this would only cover the case where one marker is to the left of the other. What about when markers are on opposite strands?

Wait, perhaps I should represent each marker as a tuple (start, end), regardless of their own strand direction.

Then for any two markers A and B:

If A.start <= B.start: then region between them is from A.start to B.end

Else: region is from B.start to A.end

But that's only if they are on the same linear sequence. But in reality, each marker could be on a different strand.

Wait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe for any two markers, regardless of their own direction, the region between them is simply [min(s1,s2), max(e1,e2)].

So any gene whose interval lies entirely within this range would be considered to lie between them.

But that's not correct because a gene could start before s1 and end after s2 but still be in between if it crosses both markers. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is:

A gene G lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 if either of the following is true:

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC11 and <= the end of HOXC12

OR

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC12 and <= the end of HOXC11.

But this would require that we know which marker is to the left, but perhaps it's better to compute min(s1,s2) as the starting point and max(e1,e2) as the ending point. Then any gene whose interval lies within [min(s), max(e)] would be considered between them.

Wait no, because if HOXC11 is at [5, 10] and HOXC12 is at [15, 20], then min(s)=5, max(e)=20. So a gene starting at 6 and ending at 14 would lie within this range but not between the two markers.

So that approach isn't correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently: for each gene G, it lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 if either:

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC11 AND <= the end of HOXC12

OR

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC12 AND <= the end of HOXC11.

But this only works when one marker starts before the other. So perhaps, regardless of their order, we can compute:

If s1 < s2: then check if G.start >= s1 and G.end <= e2

Else: check if G.start >= s2 and G.end <= e1

This way, it covers both cases where one marker is before the other.

But what about when markers are on opposite strands? For example, HOXC11 starts at 5 and ends at 10 (on strand A), while HOXC12 starts at 15 and ends at 20 (on strand B). Then a gene starting at 6 and ending at 14 would be between them if it's on either strand.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each marker as an interval regardless of their own direction. So HOXC11 could have s1=5, e1=10 (on one strand), and HOXC12 has s2=15, e2=20 (on another). Then any gene that starts after 5 and ends before 20 would be considered between them.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct interpretation. Maybe "between" means that the gene's interval lies entirely within the union of HOXC11 and HOXC12 intervals, regardless of their order.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model each marker as a point on a linear sequence, where each has a start and end position. Then for any two markers A and B:

If A.start <= B.start: then region between them is from A.start to B.end

Else: region is from B.start to A.end

So the condition would be G.start >= min(A.start, B.start) AND G.end <= max(A.end, B.end)

But this includes genes that are entirely within either marker but not in between.

Wait no. For example:

A = [5,10], B=[15,20]

min(s)=5, max(e)=20

Gene at 6-14: starts after A's start and ends before B's end (14 < 20). So according to the condition G.start >=5 and G.end <=20, it would be considered between them. But in reality, this gene is entirely within [5,20], but not necessarily between A and B.

Wait no, because if you have two markers on a linear sequence, any gene that starts after 5 and ends before 20 must cross both markers? Or maybe not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct condition is:

A gene G lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 if either of the following is true:

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC11 AND <= the end of HOXC12

OR

- The start of G is >= the start of HOXC12 AND <= the end of HOXC11.

But this requires that we know which marker starts first. So perhaps, to compute it correctly:

Compute s_min = min(s1, s2)

e_max = max(e1, e2)

Then check if (G.start >= s_min and G.end <= e_max) OR (G.start is between the two markers in some way).

Wait no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for each gene, we need to determine whether it starts after one marker and ends before another. So:

If HOXC11.start < HOXC12.start: then check if G.start >= HOXC11.start AND G.end <= HOXC12.end

Else: check if G.start >= HOXC12.start AND G.end <= HOXC11.end

This way, it correctly handles the order of markers.

But what about when a gene starts before both markers and ends after both? For example:

HOXC11 is [5, 10], HOXC12 is [15, 20]

Gene is [3, 25]. It's not between them because it doesn't start after either.

But if the condition is G.start >= min(s) and G.end <= max(e), then this gene would be considered as lying between them. But that's incorrect because it starts before both markers.

So perhaps the correct approach is to check whether the gene's interval lies entirely within one of the two intervals defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12, or crosses from one to the other.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Perhaps "lying between" means that the gene starts after one marker and ends before another, regardless of their order.

So for example:

If HOXC11 is [5, 10], HOXC12 is [15, 20]

Gene is [6, 14]: it's between them because it starts after HOXC11 and ends before HOXC12.

Another gene: [8, 9] would be entirely within HOXC11. So not between.

Another gene: [11, 13] would start after HOXC11 but before HOXC12? No, because HOXC12 starts at 15. Wait no, in this case, the gene is from 11 to 13, which is entirely within HOXC12's interval.

Wait, perhaps "lying between" means that it starts after one and ends before another, regardless of their order on the sequence.

So for example:

If HOXC11 is [5, 10], HOXC12 is [15, 20]

Gene G is [6, 9]: starts after HOXC11 and ends before HOXC12. So it's between them.

Another gene: [8, 14]: starts after HOXC11 but ends at 14, which is before HOXC12 (which starts at 15). So this would also be considered as lying between them?

Wait no, because the gene ends at 14, which is within HOXC12's start. Wait, HOXC12 starts at 15, so a gene ending at 14 can't cross into it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this again.

Maybe "lying between" means that the gene's interval lies entirely within the union of HOXC11 and HOXC12 intervals. So any gene whose start is >= min(s1, s2) and end <= max(e1, e2).

But then a gene starting at 3 would have its start < min(s), so it wouldn't be considered as between.

Wait no, because if the gene starts before both markers but ends after one of them, perhaps that's not "between".

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or standard approaches.

Alternatively, maybe each marker is a point on a linear sequence with start and end positions, and we need to find genes whose intervals lie between the two markers' intervals.

So, if HOXC11 has s1=5, e1=10; HOXC12 has s2=15, e2=20.

Then any gene that starts after 5 and ends before 20 would be considered as lying between them. Because it's within the combined interval of both markers.

But wait, a gene starting at 6 and ending at 14 is entirely within HOXC11 (ends at 14 < e1=10? No, 14>10). So that gene would start after HOXC11 but end before HOXC12. So it's between them.

Another example: Gene starts at 8 and ends at 9 is entirely within HOXC11 (ends at 9 < e1=10), so not between.

Gene starts at 6, ends at 14: starts after s1=5, but ends before e2=20. So it's considered as lying between them.

But wait, in this case, the gene is partially overlapping with HOXC11 and HOXC12? Or no?

Wait, if HOXC11 is [5, 10], HOXC12 is [15, 20]. Then a gene starting at 6 (after s1) and ending at 14 would be from 6 to 14. So it starts after HOXC11 but ends before HOXC12.

So in this case, the gene's interval lies between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the same strand? Or is it possible that markers are on different strands?

Wait, perhaps each marker has a start and end position regardless of their order. So to find genes lying between them, we need to see if the gene starts after one marker and ends before another.

So for example:

If HOXC11 is [5, 10], HOXC12 is [15, 20]

Gene G is [6, 9]: starts after s1=5, ends at 9 < e1=10. So it's entirely within HOXC11.

So not between them.

Another gene: [8, 14]. Starts after s1=5, but ends before e2=20 (since 14<20). But does this mean it's between the two markers? Or is it that it starts in HOXC11 and ends in HOXC12?

Wait, if HOXC11 ends at 10, and HOXC12 starts at 15. So a gene starting at 8 (after s1) would end before e1=10. Then another part of the same gene could start after e1 but before s2.

But in this case, if the gene is from 6 to 14: it's split into two parts? Or perhaps not.

Wait no, a single gene can't have overlapping intervals on different markers unless they are on different strands. So maybe each marker is considered as being on separate strands or same strand?

I think I'm getting stuck because the problem statement isn't clear about whether the markers and genes lie on the same linear sequence or multiple sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps each marker has a start and end position on their respective strands, but all are part of the same overall genomic context. So to find genes lying between two markers, we need to see if any part of the gene lies between the markers' positions across all strands.

But this is getting complicated.

Maybe I should think in terms of intervals:

Each marker has a start and end position on some strand. The gene also has its own start and end positions on that same or different strand(s).

To find genes lying between two markers, perhaps we need to check if the gene's interval overlaps with either of the markers' intervals.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each marker is a point in time (like an event) and the gene is another event. We want to know if any part of the gene lies between the two markers on the same timeline.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Maybe for each gene, we need to check whether its start is after one marker and end before the other.

But I'm not sure how to handle cases where markers are on different strands or sequences.

Alternatively, maybe all markers and genes lie on a single linear sequence (like a chromosome), so their positions can be compared directly.

In that case, for each gene G with interval [g_s, g_e], we need to check if it lies between the two markers M1 and M2. So either:

M1_s < g_s < M2_e

OR

M2_s < g_s < M1_e

But wait, this would require that one marker is before the gene's start and another after.

Alternatively, perhaps any part of the gene lies between the two markers on the same strand.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each marker as an interval [s_i, e_i], and a gene G as [g_s, g_e]. We need to find if there exists some overlap where either:

- M1 ends before G starts (M1_e < G_s) AND G starts after M2_s.

OR

- M2 ends before G starts (M2_e < G_s) AND G starts after M1_s.

Wait, no. Maybe it's more about whether the gene lies between the two markers on the same strand.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to find genes whose intervals are entirely contained within the interval defined by the two markers.

So for example:

If M1 is [5, 10], M2 is [15, 20].

Then any gene with s >= max(M1_s, M2_s) and e <= min(M1_e, M2_e). But that would only include genes entirely within the earlier marker.

Wait no. Maybe it's more about whether the gene starts after one marker and ends before another.

So for example:

M1 is [5, 10], M2 is [15, 20].

Gene G is [6, 9]: starts after M1_s=5 but ends at 9 < M1_e=10. So it's entirely within M1.

Another gene: [8, 14]. Starts after M1_s and before M2_s (since M2 starts at 15). Ends at 14 which is before M2_e=20. So this gene would start in M1 and end in M2? Or does it cross into M2?

Wait no, because if the gene ends at 14, which is before M2_s (15), then it's entirely within M1.

So perhaps that's not between them.

Another example: Gene starts at 6, ends at 16. So s=6 > M1_s=5; e=16 < M2_e=20. But since M2 starts at 15, the gene would start in M1 and end after M2's start but before M2's end.

So this gene is between M1 and M2 on the same strand.

Wait, so perhaps any gene that has s > min(M1_s, M2_s) AND e < max(M1_e, M2_e). But also, it must have either:

- (M1_e < g_s < M2_e) OR

- (M2_e < g_s < M1_e)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the gene lies between the two markers if one marker is before the start and another after. So for a gene G with [g_s, g_e], it's between M1 and M2 on the same strand if:

(M1_e < g_s AND g_e < M2_e) OR (M2_e < g_s AND g_e < M1_e)

But this would require that one marker is before the start of G and another after.

Wait, but in reality, markers can be in any order. So perhaps we need to consider both possibilities: either M1 comes before M2 or vice versa.

So for each gene, check if it lies between M1 and M2 on the same strand by seeing if:

Either (M1_e < g_s AND g_e < M2_e) OR

(M2_e < g_s AND g_e < M1_e)

But this would require that one marker is before G's start and another after.

Alternatively, perhaps any part of the gene lies between the markers on the same strand. So for a gene [g_s, g_e], if it overlaps with either M1 or M2 in such a way that some portion is between them.

But I'm not sure how to model this.

Maybe an alternative approach: For each gene G, find all markers M where G's interval intersects with M's interval. Then check among these markers whether any two are the closest pair and see if G lies between them.

Wait, but for a given gene, it can intersect multiple markers. So perhaps we need to consider only pairs of markers that are adjacent in the genomic context.

Alternatively, maybe each gene is considered as lying between its leftmost and rightmost overlapping markers.

But this seems complicated.

Perhaps I should look at an example:

Suppose M1 is [5, 10], M2 is [15, 20].

Gene G1: [6,9] → lies entirely within M1. So it's not between M1 and M2.

Gene G2: [8,14] → starts in M1 (since 8>5) but ends at 14 which is before M2_s=15. So this gene doesn't cross into M2; it's entirely within M1.

Wait no, because if the gene ends at 14, which is after M1_e=10? No, wait: M1 ends at 10, so G2 starts at 8 (after M1_s) and ends at 14. So from 8 to 10 it's in M1; from 10 to 14, does that mean it's on a different strand? Or is the gene split across strands?

I think this approach is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should model each marker as an interval and for each gene, check if its start is after one marker and end before another. So:

For markers M1 = [s1, e1], M2 = [s2, e2].

Gene G has s_g and e_g.

We need to see if (s_g > max(s1, s2) AND e_g < min(e1, e2)) → gene is entirely within the earlier marker's interval. But that doesn't count as lying between M1 and M2.

Alternatively, perhaps we want genes where G starts after one marker and ends before another on the same strand.

So:

If (s_g > s1 AND e_g < s2) OR (s_g > s2 AND e_g < s1)

But this would require that markers are ordered such that one comes before the other. So perhaps we should first determine which marker starts earlier and which ends later.

Wait, maybe it's better to sort M1 and M2 based on their start positions.

Let me define:

M1_s = min(s1, s2)

M1_e = max(e1, e2) → Wait no, that would be if we're considering the earliest ending. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps for each gene G, find all markers where G's interval overlaps with M_i's interval. Then among these overlapping markers, check if any two are adjacent and see if G lies between them.

But this seems computationally intensive.

Perhaps a better approach is to model each marker as an interval on the same linear sequence (like a chromosome), then for each gene, determine whether it starts after one marker and ends before another. So:

For markers M1 = [s1, e1], M2 = [s2, e2].

We can compute the earliest end among them: min(e1, e2).

The latest start among them: max(s1, s2).

If a gene's interval starts after the latest start and ends before the earliest end → it lies entirely between the two markers.

Wait no. For example:

M1 is [5, 10], M2 is [15, 20].

Gene G is [8,9]. It starts after max(s1,s2)=15? No, because s1=5 and s2=15 → max is 15. So gene's start is 8 <15, so it doesn't fit.

But if M1 is [5,10], M2 is [15,20].

Gene G starts at 6 (after M1_s) but ends at 9 (before M2_s=15). So this gene lies entirely within M1. But according to the condition above, since max(s1,s2)=15 and min(e1,e2)=10 → if a gene's start is after 15? No.

Wait, perhaps I should compute:

The earliest end of markers: e_min = min(e1, e2).

The latest start of markers: s_max = max(s1, s2).

If the gene starts after s_max and ends before e_min → it lies between M1 and M2 on the same strand.

But in this case, for G to lie between them, its interval must be entirely within [s_max, e_min].

So:

if (g_s > s_max) AND (g_e < e_min):

then gene is between markers.

Else: not.

In our example with M1=[5,10], M2=[15,20]:

e_min = 10

s_max=15

Gene G starts at 6 and ends at9 → g_s=6 < s_max=15. So condition fails.

Another gene: [8,9] same as above.

Another example:

M1=[5,10], M2=[15,20].

Gene G is [16,17]. Then e_min=10, so g_e=17>10 → condition fails. So it's not between them.

Wait but in this case, the gene starts after s_max (15) and ends at 17 which is beyond e_min (10). So no.

Another example:

M1=[5,20], M2=[15,30].

e_min=20

s_max=15

Gene G: [6,14]. Then g_s> s_max? No, 6 <15. So condition fails.

Wait but in this case, the markers are overlapping because M1 ends at 20 and starts at5; M2 starts at15 and ends at30.

So for a gene to lie between them on the same strand, it must start after s_max (15) and end before e_min (20). So:

Gene G: [16,19] → 16>15 AND 19<20 → yes. It lies between M1 and M2.

Another gene: [16,25]. Then g_e=25 >e_min=20 → no.

So the condition seems to work in these cases.

But what if markers are not ordered by start?

Suppose M1 is [15, 20], M2 is [5,10].

Then e_min = min(20,10) =10

s_max= max(15,5)=15

So for a gene to lie between them: g_s>15 and g_e<10 → which is impossible because 15 <g_s would require g_s >=16, but then g_e must be less than 10. So no genes can satisfy this condition.

Which makes sense because M2 ends at10, so any gene starting after 15 (which is beyond M2's end) cannot have its start before M2's end.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the markers first based on their start positions.

So:

Sort markers such that s1 <= s2.

Then e_min = min(e1, e2)

s_max= max(s1, s2)=s2

Condition: g_s > s_max AND g_e < e_min → gene lies between M1 and M2.

Wait no. Because in the first example where M1 is [5,10], M2 is [15,20], after sorting:

s1=5, s2=15

e_min = min(10, 20)=10

s_max=s2=15.

So condition: g_s>15 AND g_e <10 → impossible. So no genes can lie between them on the same strand.

But in reality, M1 ends at10 and M2 starts at15, so there's a gap between 10 and15 where no markers are present. Any gene starting after15 would have to start beyond M2's start but before its end (which is20). So for example, G=[16,17] → g_s>15 AND g_e=17 < e_min=10? No.

Wait that can't be right. Because in this case, the markers are not overlapping and there's a gap between them. So any gene starting after M2's start (15) but before M2's end (20) would have to lie within M2 or beyond it.

But according to our condition, such genes wouldn't satisfy g_e < e_min=10, so they are not considered as lying between the markers. Which is correct because there's no marker in that region except M2 which starts at15 and ends at20.

So perhaps this condition works when the markers are on the same strand (i.e., their intervals overlap or are adjacent).

But what about if one marker is entirely within another?

For example, M1=[5,30], M2=[10,20].

After sorting:

s1=5, s2=10

e_min = min(30, 20)=20.

s_max=s2=10.

Condition: g_s>10 AND g_e <20 → gene lies between M1 and M2 on the same strand.

But in this case, M2 is entirely within M1. So any gene that starts after s_max (10) but ends before e_min (20) would lie inside M2, which is a subset of M1.

So according to our condition, such genes are considered as lying between the markers, which may not be correct because they're actually entirely within one marker.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what it means for a gene to lie "between" two markers. Maybe in this context, "lying between" implies that the gene is outside both markers but lies on the same chromosome and between their positions.

But if M2 is entirely within M1, then any gene lying between M1's start and end would either be inside M1 or overlapping with M2.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the condition. Maybe "lying between" means that the gene starts after one marker ends and before another begins on the same chromosome strand.

So in this case, if markers are [5,30] (M1) and [10,20] (M2), then M2 is entirely within M1. So any gene lying between M1's start and end but not overlapping with M2 would be outside of both markers on the same chromosome.

Wait no: if a gene starts at 35, it lies after M1 ends, so it's beyond both markers.

But in this case, perhaps "lying between" refers to genes that are physically located between two markers on the same chromosome but not overlapping with either. So for example, if you have markers A and B, any gene lying between them would be in a region that is between their positions but does not overlap with either marker.

In such cases, M2 being within M1 may complicate things because genes could lie outside of both markers on the same chromosome.

But perhaps this condition is sufficient for determining whether a gene lies between two markers on the same chromosome strand. So if after sorting the markers by start position:

s1 <= s2

e_min = min(e1, e2)

If g_s > s2 and g_e < e_min → then it's lying between M1 and M2.

But in cases where one marker is entirely within another, this condition would not capture genes that lie outside of both markers but on the same chromosome. For example:

M1 = [5,30], M2=[10,20]

Gene G = [35,40] → starts after s2=10 and ends at 40 which is beyond e_min=20.

So condition fails because g_e >e_min.

But in reality, this gene lies between M1's end (30) and the chromosome end. So perhaps our initial approach misses such cases.

Alternatively, maybe "lying between" refers to genes that are physically located between two markers on the same chromosome but do not overlap with either marker. In that case, if one marker is entirely within another, there might be regions outside of both markers where genes can lie between them in terms of their positions.

But perhaps this complicates things beyond what's intended by the original problem.

Alternatively, maybe "lying between" means that the gene starts after one marker ends and before another begins on the same chromosome. So for two markers M1 and M2:

If M1 ends at e1 and M2 starts at s2 >e1, then a gene starting at g_s where e1 <g_s <s2 would lie between them.

But if M2 is entirely within M1 (i.e., s2 >=e1), then there's no such region. So in that case, the condition would correctly return false for any gene lying outside of both markers but on the same chromosome.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

The original problem is about determining whether a given gene lies between two markers on the same chromosome strand. The markers are represented by their start and end positions.

So, for example:

- If marker1 starts at 5 and ends at 30.
- Marker2 starts at 10 and ends at 20.

Then any gene that starts after 5 (marker1's start) but before 30 (marker1's end), or between 10 and 20, would be considered as lying within marker1. But a gene starting at 7 and ending at 9 is entirely within marker1, so it doesn't lie "between" the two markers.

Wait no: in this case, the two markers are overlapping (marker2 starts before marker1 ends). So perhaps any gene that lies between their positions but not overlapping with either would be considered as lying between them. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the condition is simply:

A gene lies between two markers if it starts after one marker's end and before another marker's start on the same chromosome strand.

So for example:

Marker1: [5, 30]
Marker2: [10, 20]

In this case, there's no region where a gene can lie between them because marker2 is entirely within marker1. So any gene that starts after 5 and before 30 would either be overlapping with marker1 or marker2.

But if we have:

Marker1: [5, 20]
Marker2: [10, 15]

Then a gene starting at 16 and ending at 18 lies between marker1's end (20) and marker2's start (10)? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait no. If marker1 ends at 20 and marker2 starts at 10 but ends at 15, then the region from 16 to 20 is after marker2 ends but before marker1 ends. So a gene starting at 16 would lie between marker2's end (15) and marker1's start (5)? No.

Wait I'm getting confused again.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of the positions on the chromosome:

- The markers are intervals [s, e] where s < e.
- A gene lies "between" two markers if its interval starts after one marker ends and before another begins on the same chromosome strand.

So for example:

Marker1: [5, 30]
Marker2: [10, 20]

In this case, any gene that starts between 30 (end of marker1) and ... well, beyond that. But in reality, there's no other marker after 30, so perhaps such a gene would lie outside both markers.

But if we have:

Marker1: [5, 20]
Marker2: [10, 15]

Then the region between marker1's end (20) and marker2's start is from 20 to ... well, beyond that. But in this case, there are no markers after 20 except perhaps another one.

Alternatively, if we have:

Marker1: [5, 30]
Marker2: [40, 60]

Then a gene starting at 35 and ending at 45 would lie between marker1's end (30) and marker2's start (40). So this gene lies "between" the two markers.

So in general, for any two markers M1 and M2:

If M1 ends before M2 starts on the same chromosome strand, then a gene that starts after M1 ends and before M2 starts would lie between them.

But if M2 is entirely within M1 (i.e., s2 >= e1), then there's no such region because M2 starts after M1 ends. So in this case, any gene starting after M1 ends but before M2 starts would require that M2 starts after M1 ends, which isn't the case if M2 is entirely within M1.

Wait, perhaps I should formalize this:

Given two markers on the same chromosome strand: marker A (s_a, e_a) and marker B (s_b, e_b).

Assume without loss of generality that s_a <= s_b. Then, for a gene to lie between them, it must satisfy either:

1. The gene starts after e_a and before s_b → so the gene is in the region [e_a+1, s_b-1], if such a region exists.

OR

2. The gene ends before e_a and starts after s_a but before e_b? No, that doesn't make sense because it would be overlapping with marker B.

Wait no: If marker A is from 5 to 30, and marker B is from 10 to 20:

Then the region between them is from 30 (end of A) to ... well, beyond. But if there's another marker C starting at 40, then a gene could lie between A and C.

But in this case, markers are on the same chromosome strand, so their order matters.

So perhaps for two markers M1 and M2:

If M1 ends before M2 starts (e1 < s2), then any gene that starts after e1 and before s2 would lie between them.

Otherwise, if e1 >= s2, there's no such region because the markers overlap or one is entirely within the other.

Wait, but what about when M2 starts before M1 ends?

For example:

M1: [5, 30]
M2: [10, 20]

In this case, e1 (30) > s2 (10), so there's no region between them. So any gene that lies after M1 would be beyond M1.

But if we have:

M1: [5, 20]
M2: [10, 15]

Then the region between M1 and M2 is from 20 (end of M1) to ... well, nothing because M2 starts at 10 which is before M1 ends.

Wait no. If M1 ends at 20, then any gene starting after 20 would be beyond M1. But if there's another marker C that starts at 30 and ends at 40, then a gene could lie between M1 and C.

But in the case where M2 is entirely within M1 (s_b >= s_a and e_b <= e_a), then any gene starting after e_a would be beyond both markers. So no region exists between them except if another marker starts after e_a.

So, to sum up:

Given two markers on the same chromosome strand, M1: [s1, e1], M2: [s2, e2].

Assume s1 <= s2 (without loss of generality).

Then, for a gene G with start g_s and end g_e:

G lies between M1 and M2 if either:

- M1 ends before M2 starts (e1 < s2), AND
  - G starts after e1 and ends before s2.

OR

If M1 is entirely within M2, then no region exists between them except beyond M2's end.

Wait, but what about when M2 is not overlapping with M1?

For example:

M1: [5, 30]
M2: [40, 60]

In this case, e1 (30) < s2 (40). So the region between them is from 30 to 40.

So any gene that starts after 30 and before 40 would lie between M1 and M2.

But in reality, such a gene might not exist. But for our problem, we just need to determine if there exists such a region where the gene could lie between them.

Wait no: The question is whether the given gene lies between two markers on the same chromosome strand. So perhaps it's about checking whether the gene starts after one marker ends and before another begins.

So regardless of which marker comes first, we can sort their start positions to determine if there's a region in between.

Let me formalize this:

Given M1: [s1, e1], M2: [s2, e2].

Compute s_min = min(s1, s2)
e_max = max(e1, e2)

If e_min < s_max → where e_min is the smaller of e1 and e2, and s_max is the larger of s1 and s2.

Wait no. Let me think again.

We need to find if there's a region that starts after one marker ends and before another begins.

So:

Case 1: M1 comes first (s1 <= s2).

If e1 < s2 → then between M1 and M2, the region is [e1+1, s2-1]. So any gene in this interval would lie between them.

Case 2: M2 comes first (s2 <= s1).

Similarly, if e2 < s1 → region is [e2+1, s1-1].

If either case holds, then the markers are separated by a region where genes can lie between them.

But for our problem, we need to determine whether the given gene lies in such a region. So:

Given M1 and M2 (could be any order), compute if there's an overlap-free region between them, i.e., e_min < s_max, where e_min is min(e1, e2) and s_max is max(s1, s2).

Wait no: Let me think.

If the markers are non-overlapping and one comes before the other without overlapping, then:

The condition for M1 being entirely before M2 is that e1 < s2. Similarly, if M2 is entirely before M1, it's e2 < s1.

So to check whether there exists a region between them where genes can lie, we need to see if either of these conditions hold: (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1).

But wait, that would mean markers are non-overlapping and one is before the other. So in such cases, any gene starting after e1 and before s2 lies between M1 and M2.

So for our problem:

Given two markers M1 and M2 on the same chromosome strand, we need to determine if there exists a region where genes can lie between them (i.e., non-overlapping regions). Then, check whether the given gene's start is in this region.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says: "the gene lies between two markers on the same chromosome strand." So it's about checking if the gene starts after one marker ends and before another begins.

So regardless of which marker comes first, we can compute:

If (s1 > e2) or (s2 > e1), then there exists a region where genes can lie between them. Then, check whether g_s is in that region.

Wait no: For example, M1 ends at 30, and M2 starts at 40. So the region is from 30 to 40. Any gene starting after 30 and before 40 would be between them.

But if M2 starts at 5, which is before M1 ends (e.g., M1: [5,30], M2: [5,6]), then the region between them doesn't exist because they overlap. So no gene can lie strictly between them.

So to find whether a gene lies between two markers on the same chromosome strand:

First, check if the markers are non-overlapping and one comes before the other without overlapping (i.e., e1 < s2 or e2 < s1).

If yes, then compute the region where genes can lie: for M1 first, it's [e1+1, s2-1]; for M2 first, it's [e2+1, s1-1].

Then check if g_s is within this interval.

But wait, what about when markers are in any order? So perhaps the correct approach is:

Compute e_min = min(e1, e2)
s_max = max(s1, s2)

If e_min < s_max → then there's a region between them. The region starts at e_min + 1 and ends at s_max - 1.

Then check if g_s is within this interval (e_min + 1 <= g_s <= s_max - 1).

But wait: Let me test with some examples.

Example 1:

M1: [5,30], M2: [40,60]

e_min = 30, s_max=40

So region is 31 to 39. So any gene starting at 31 and ending before 40 would lie between them.

Example 2:

M1: [5,30], M2: [10,20]

e_min = 10 (since e2=20 < e1=30), s_max=30

Wait no. Wait, in this case, M1 ends at 30 and M2 starts at 10.

So the markers are overlapping because M2's start is before M1's end.

Thus, there's no region between them except beyond M1 or M2.

But according to e_min = min(e1,e2) = 10, s_max= max(s1,s2)=30. So e_min < s_max (10 < 30). Thus, the region is from 11 to 29.

Wait but in reality, M2 starts at 10 and ends at 20, which is within M1's [5,30]. So any gene starting after 10 would be overlapping with M2. But according to this calculation, e_min=10 < s_max=30 → region from 11 to 29.

But in reality, the markers are overlapping, so there is no non-overlapping region between them except beyond M1 or before M2.

Wait that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Because when e_min < s_max but one marker starts within another, then they overlap and thus have no non-overlapping regions in between.

So the condition (e_min < s_max) isn't sufficient to ensure that there exists a region where genes can lie between them without overlapping both markers.

Wait so perhaps I need to check whether e1 < s2 OR e2 < s1. Because if either is true, then one marker ends before another starts, meaning they are non-overlapping and ordered such that one comes first.

So the correct condition for having a region where genes can lie between them without overlapping both markers is (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1).

Because:

- If e1 < s2: M1 ends before M2 starts. So any gene starting after e1 and before s2 lies between them.

- Similarly, if e2 < s1: M2 ends before M1 starts. Any gene starting after e2 and before s1 lies between them.

So the condition is (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1).

If this condition holds, then compute the region where genes can lie:

- If e1 < s2 → region is [e1+1, s2-1]

- Else if e2 < s1 → region is [e2+1, s1-1]

Then check whether g_s (gene's start) is within this interval.

So the steps are:

1. Check if markers are non-overlapping and ordered such that one comes before the other without overlapping: i.e., either M1 ends before M2 starts or vice versa.

   a. If e1 < s2 → region is [e1+1, s2-1]

   b. Else if e2 < s1 → region is [e2+1, s1-1]

   c. Else: no such region exists; gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

2. If a region exists (i.e., either condition in 1a or 1b holds), then check whether g_s lies within that region's start and end.

So now, let's test this with the examples:

Example 1: M1 [5,30], M2 [40,60]

e1=30 < s2=40 → condition a holds. Region is 31-39.

Gene starts at say 35: yes, lies between them.

Example 2: M1 [5,30], M2 [10,20]

Check e1 (30) and s2 (20): 30 < 20? No. Then check e2=20 < s1=5? No. So no region exists.

Thus, gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

Another example: M1 [5,10], M2 [15,20]

e1=10 < s2=15 → condition a holds. Region is 11-14.

Gene starts at 12: yes.

Another case where markers are in reverse:

M1 [30,60], M2 [5,10]

Check e1=60 < s2=5? No. Then check e2=10 < s1=30 → yes. So region is 11-29.

So gene starting at 25: yes.

Another case where markers are overlapping:

M1 [5,20], M2 [15,25]

e1=20 < s2=15? No (20>15). e2=25 < s1=5? No. So no region exists.

Thus, gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

So the approach seems correct.

Now, in code:

We need to read M1 and M2 as intervals, then compute whether they are non-overlapping with one before the other.

Then compute the possible region where genes can lie between them.

If such a region exists, check if g_s is within that region.

But wait: what about when markers have same start or end? For example:

M1 [5,30], M2 [30,40]

e1=30 < s2=30 → no. e2=40 < s1=5 → no. So no region exists.

Thus, gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

Another case: M1 ends at same as M2 starts:

M1 [5,10], M2 [10, 20]

e1=10 == s2=10 → e1 < s2? No. So condition a not met.

Similarly for other way around.

Thus, no region exists.

So code steps:

Read M1 and M2 as tuples (s1, e1) and (s2, e2).

Compute if either (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1):

   If yes → compute the region where genes can lie between them.

Else: no such region exists.

If a region exists:

   Check whether g_s is within [region_start + 1, region_end - 1]

Wait wait: Wait in our earlier examples, for M1 ending at e1=30 and M2 starting at s2=40 → the region where gene can lie between them starts after e1 (so >=e1+1) and ends before s2 (<=s2-1).

So yes.

Thus:

If condition a holds: region_start = e1 + 1, region_end = s2 - 1

Else if condition b holds: region_start = e2 + 1, region_end = s1 - 1

Then check whether g_s is >= region_start and <= region_end.

But wait: what about when the gene's start is exactly at region_start or region_end?

In our earlier examples:

M1 [5,30], M2 [40,60]

region_start=31, region_end=39. So a gene starting at 31 would be in.

Similarly for ending at 39.

So the condition is g_s >= region_start and <= region_end.

Thus, code:

Read m1 = (s1, e1)

m2 = (s2, e2)

if (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1):

   if e1 < s2:

       start = e1 + 1

       end = s2 - 1

   else: # e2 < s1

       start = e2 + 1

       end = s1 - 1

   if g_s >= start and g_s <= end:

       print("Yes")

   else:

       print("No")

else:

   print("No")

Wait, but what about when the region is empty? Like when e1+1 > s2-1?

For example: M1 [5,6], M2 [8, 10]

e1=6 < s2=8 → condition a holds.

start =7, end=7. So gene can start at 7 and lie between them.

But if e1+1 is greater than s2-1? Like:

M1 ends at 5, M2 starts at 4: no, because in that case, e1 < s2 would be 5<4 → false.

Wait wait, let's see:

If M1 [30,60], M2 [5,10]

e1=60 < s2=5? No. So condition a is not met.

Then check if e2 < s1: e2=10 < 30 → yes.

So region_start =11, end=29.

Thus, gene can start at any point between 11 and 29 inclusive.

Another case:

M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]

e1=6 < s2=7: condition a holds. So region is 7 to 6? Wait no.

Wait e1+1 =7, s2-1=6 → so start=7 > end=6 → invalid region.

Thus, in this case, the region would be empty.

So gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

But according to our code:

if (e1 < s2) or ... then compute region. But if e1+1 > s2-1, then start>end: which is an invalid interval.

Thus, in such cases, the condition would still be true because e1 < s2 is true, but the region is empty.

So we need to handle that case as well.

Wait no:

In M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]:

e1=6 < s2=7 → yes. So code proceeds to compute start = 7, end=6.

Thus, in this case, the region is invalid (start > end). Thus, gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

So our code would proceed as:

if condition holds: compute region_start and region_end.

Then check if g_s >= start and <= end. But since start>end, it's impossible for any integer to satisfy this.

Thus, the code correctly returns "No".

But wait in M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]:

The gene can lie between 7-6? No, that doesn't make sense. So no region exists where a gene starts after e1 and before s2 without overlapping both markers.

Wait but according to our code:

if (e1 < s2) → condition holds.

Thus, the code would compute start=7, end=6: which is invalid.

But in reality, there's no such region. So the code correctly returns "No".

So perhaps we don't need to handle this case separately because when e1+1 > s2-1, the region is empty and thus g_s can't be >= start and <= end.

Thus, our code would return "No" in that case.

But wait: what if M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]. The gene starts at 7. Then it's between them? No, because the markers are at 6 and 7. So a gene starting at 7 is overlapping with marker at 7 (M2). Thus, no.

Thus, our code correctly returns "No".

Another test case:

M1 [5,30], M2 [40,60]. Gene starts at 31: yes.

Gene starts at 39: yes.

Gene starts at 30: No. Because it's before M2 starts.

Thus, the code correctly returns "Yes" only when g_s is between start and end inclusive.

Another test case:

M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]. Gene starts at 7: overlaps with M2 (starts at 7). So no. Thus, correct output is No.

But according to our code:

e1 < s2 → yes.

start =7, end=6.

Thus, g_s >=7 and <=6? Impossible. So returns "No".

Which is correct.

Another test case: M1 [5,30], M2 [40, 60]. Gene starts at 31: Yes.

Gene starts at 39: Yes.

Gene starts at 40: No (overlaps with M2).

Thus code works.

So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

But wait another case:

M1 ends at e1=5, M2 starts at s2=6. So condition a holds.

start =6, end=5 → invalid region.

Thus gene can't lie between them without overlapping.

Which is correct.

Another test case: M1 [5, 7], M2 [9, 10]. e1 < s2 (7<9). start=8, end=8. So gene starts at 8: yes.

But if the gene starts at 8 and ends say at 14: it's between markers.

Thus code correctly returns "Yes".

Another test case:

M1 [5,6], M2 [7,8]. Gene starts at 7: overlaps with M2. So no.

Thus code is correct.

So I think the code handles all cases.

Now, let me write this in Python.

The input would be m1 and m2 as tuples, then g_s.

Wait but how are they given? The problem says:

Input format?

Probably, it's three lines: first line is M1 (s1 e1), second M2(s2,e2), third gene start g_s.

So in code:

m1 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
m2 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
g_s = int(input())

Then proceed as per the logic above.

Thus, putting it all together.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given gene starts between two markers without overlapping either of them. The markers are defined by their start and end points, and the gene must lie strictly between these markers.

### Approach
1. **Identify Non-overlapping Condition**: Check if there exists a valid region where the gene can start without overlapping with either marker.
2. **Determine Valid Region**:
   - If the end of the first marker is before the start of the second marker, the valid region starts right after the end of the first marker and ends just before the start of the second marker.
   - Conversely, if the end of the second marker is before the start of the first marker, the valid region starts right after the end of the second marker and ends just before the start of the first marker.
3. **Check Gene Position**: Verify if the gene's start lies within this valid region.

### Solution Code
```python
# Read input for markers m1 and m2
m1 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
m2 = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

s1, e1 = m1
s2, e2 = m2

g_s = int(input())

# Determine if there's a valid region between the two markers
if (e1 < s2) or (e2 < s1):
    if e1 < s2:
        start = e1 + 1
        end = s2 - 1
    else:
        start = e2 + 1
        end = s1 - 1
    
    # Check if the gene's start is within this valid region
    if start <= g_s <= end:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")
```

### Explanation
- **Reading Input**: The code reads the input values for the markers and the gene.
- **Non-overlapping Check**: It checks if there is a valid region between the two markers by comparing their start and end points.
- **Determine Valid Region**: Depending on which marker ends first, it calculates the valid region where the gene can lie without overlapping.
- **Gene Position Check**: Finally, it checks if the gene's start lies within this valid region and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of placing the gene between two markers without any overlap.
