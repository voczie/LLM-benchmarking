Okay, so I need to help the user generate a stacked bar plot showing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the data is stored in a SQLite database with a 'features' table. Each feature has an 'id', 'seqid' (chromosome), 'start', 'end', and other attributes like 'gene_biotype'. 

I should extract the relevant information for each gene type on each chromosome. So, I'll need to filter the features where the featuretype is 'gene' because pseudogenes might also be in the database but we're focusing on actual genes.

Next, I have to categorize these genes into protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA. The attributes will help here: 'gene_biotype' should have values like 'protein_coding', 'lncRNA', or 'miRNA'.

I'll need to group the data by chromosome and then count how many of each gene type are present on each chromosome. Using SQL, I can write a query that selects the chromosome, counts each category, and sums up the total for each.

Once I have this summarized data, I can use matplotlib in Python to create the stacked bar plot. I'll import pandas to handle the data manipulation and plotting with seaborn for styling.

I should make sure to group by 'seqid' (chromosome) and sum the counts for each gene type. Then, calculate the proportions by dividing each count by the total number of genes on that chromosome.

Finally, I'll create a bar plot where each bar represents a chromosome, and the segments of the bar represent the proportions of each gene type.

I'll help you generate a stacked bar plot showing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Extract Gene Information**: We need to query the database for features with 'gene_biotype' as 'protein_coding', 'lncRNA', or 'miRNA'.

2. **Summarize by Chromosome**: Group the data by chromosome and count the number of genes in each category.

3. **Calculate Proportions**: For each chromosome, calculate the proportion of each gene type relative to the total number of genes on that chromosome.

Here's a Python code template using SQLite, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Query to get gene information by chromosome and type
query = """
SELECT 
    f.seqid AS chromosome,
    COUNT(f.id) AS count,
    CASE 
        WHEN f.gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' THEN 'protein_coding'
        WHEN f.gene_biotype = 'lncRNA' THEN 'lncRNA'
        WHEN f.gene_biotype = 'miRNA' THEN 'miRNA'
        ELSE 'other'
    END AS type
FROM 
    features f
WHERE 
    f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
    f.gene_biotype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA')
GROUP BY 
    chromosome, type;
"""

# Create a DataFrame from the query result
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Calculate proportions
total_per_chromosome = df.groupby('chromosome')['count'].transform('sum')
df['proportion'] = df['count'] / total_per_chromosome

# Melt the data for plotting
melted_df = df.pivot(index='chromosome', columns='type', values='proportion')

# Create stacked bar plot
ax = melted_df.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(12, 8), colormap=sns.color_palette('Set3'))

# Customize the plot
plt.title('Proportions of Gene Types by Chromosome')
plt.xlabel('Chromosome')
plt.ylabel('Proportion')
plt.legend(title='Gene Type')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This code will:
1. Query the database to get counts of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome.
2. Calculate the proportions of each gene type per chromosome.
3. Create a stacked bar plot showing these proportions.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file path.
