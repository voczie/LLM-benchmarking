Here's a breakdown of how to query your SQLite database to find the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3, along with the SQL query:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds information about genomic features like genes and transcripts.  The `featuretype` column will tell us if it's a gene or transcript.
* **`seqid` Column:** This column specifies the chromosome name. We'll filter for entries where `seqid` is '3'.

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_genes 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '3';

SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_transcripts
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = '3';
```

**Explanation**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_genes`:** This part counts all rows that meet our criteria and labels the result as `num_genes`.
2. **`FROM features`:**  We specify that we're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '3'`:** This filters the results to include only rows where:
   * `featuretype` is 'gene' (for counting genes)
   * `seqid` is '3' (chromosome 3)

**Repeat for Transcripts**

The second query does the same thing but counts transcripts instead of genes.

**Running the Query**

1. **Connect to your database:** Use a tool like SQLiteStudio or Python's `sqlite3` library to connect to your `.db` file.
2. **Execute the queries:** Paste each SQL statement into your query interface and run them.
