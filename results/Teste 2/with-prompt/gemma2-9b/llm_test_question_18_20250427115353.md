Let's break down how to generate a stacked bar plot visualizing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome using your provided GFF/GTF data stored in a SQLite database.

**1. Data Extraction:**

   * **Query the Database:** You'll need a SQL query to retrieve gene information along with their type (protein-coding, lncRNA, miRNA) and chromosome. Here's a basic example:

     ```sql
     SELECT 
         seqid AS chromosome,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' THEN 1 END) AS protein_coding_count,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 END) AS lncRNA_count,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 END) AS miRNA_count
     FROM features
     WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
     GROUP BY seqid;
     ```

   * **Explanation:**
      - `SELECT`: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
      - `seqid AS chromosome`:  Selects the chromosome identifier and renames it as "chromosome".
      - `COUNT(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 END)`: Counts genes based on their `gene_biotype`. The `CASE` statement checks if the `gene_biotype` matches a specific category (protein-coding, lncRNA, miRNA) and returns 1 if true, otherwise 0. This allows you to count each gene type separately.
      - `GROUP BY seqid`: Groups the results by chromosome to get counts for each chromosome.

**2. Data Processing:**

   * **Calculate Proportions:** Divide the count of each gene type by the total number of genes on each chromosome to get proportions. You can do this in your Python code after retrieving the data from the database.

**3. Visualization (Stacked Bar Plot):**

   * **Choose a Library:** Use a Python plotting library like Matplotlib or Seaborn for creating the stacked bar plot.
   * **Create the Plot:** 
      - Set up the x-axis to represent chromosomes.
      - Create bars for each gene type (protein-coding, lncRNA, miRNA) on each chromosome. Stack these bars on top of each other.
      - Use appropriate colors and labels for clarity.

**Python Code Example (Illustrative):**

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your actual file name
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the SQL query (replace with your actual query)
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT 
        seqid AS chromosome,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'protein_coding' THEN 1 END) AS protein_coding_count,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 END) AS lncRNA_count,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN gene_biotype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 END) AS miRNA_count
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
    GROUP BY seqid;
""")

data = cursor.fetchall()
conn.close()

# Process data and calculate proportions (example)
chromosome_data = {}
for row in data:
    chromosome = row[0]
    protein_coding = row[1]
    lncRNA = row[2]
    miRNA = row[3]
    chromosome_data[chromosome] = {
        'protein_coding': protein_coding,
        'lncRNA': lncRNA,
        'miRNA': miRNA
    }

# Create the stacked bar plot (example using Matplotlib)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Adjust figure size as needed
for chromosome, counts in chromosome_data.items():
    plt.bar(chromosome, [counts['protein_coding'], counts['lncRNA'], counts['miRNA']], 
            bottom=[0, counts['protein_coding'], counts['protein_coding'] + counts['lncRNA']], 
            label=['Protein-coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA'])

plt.xlabel('Chromosome')
plt.ylabel('Gene Count')
plt.title('Stacked Bar Plot of Gene Types by Chromosome')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```



**Important Notes:**

* **Database Connection:** Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
* **SQL Query:** Adjust the SQL query to match your specific schema and requirements.
* **Data Processing:** Calculate proportions accurately based on your data.
* **Visualization Library:** Choose a plotting library you are comfortable with (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.).
