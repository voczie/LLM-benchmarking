Here's a breakdown of how to find the number of exons in the XIST gene using the provided SQLite database schema:

**Understanding the Schema**

* **`features` table:** This is your primary source of information. Each row represents a genomic feature (like genes, transcripts, or exons).  
    * `featuretype`: Look for rows where this field indicates "exon".
    * `attributes`: This field likely contains additional information about the exon, including its relationship to a gene.

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'exon'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "XIST"%'; -- Adjust this condition based on how gene IDs are stored in your attributes field
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet our criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**: We're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'exon'`**:  We only want rows representing exons.
4. **`AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "XIST"%'`**: This is crucial! You need to adjust this condition based on how gene IDs are stored in your `attributes` field. 

   * Common patterns:
      * `"gene_id": "XIST"` (JSON-like format)
      * `"gene_id" "XIST"` (separated by spaces)
      * `"gene_id"= "XIST"` (key-value pair)

**Important Notes:**

* **Database Connection:** Before running this query, you'll need to establish a connection to your SQLite database using Python or another suitable language.
* **Attribute Format:** Carefully examine the `attributes` field in your database to determine the correct pattern for matching the XIST gene ID.
