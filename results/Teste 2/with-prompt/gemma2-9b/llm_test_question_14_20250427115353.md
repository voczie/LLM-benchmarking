Here's how you can find the strands of the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes using a SQLite query:

```sql
SELECT attributes 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND (gene_id = 'HOTAIR' OR gene_id = 'HOXC11' OR gene_id = 'HOXC12');
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT attributes`**: This selects the `attributes` column from the `features` table, which contains information about each feature (in this case, genes).
2. **`FROM features`**: Specifies that we're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: Filters the results to include only entries representing genes.
4. **`AND (gene_id = 'HOTAIR' OR gene_id = 'HOXC11' OR gene_id = 'HOXC12')`**: Further filters the results to include only the specified genes: HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The `attributes` column likely contains a semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs. You'll need to parse this string to extract the strand information (e.g., "strand = +").
* **Database Schema:**  Make sure your database schema matches the provided example. Adjust the table and column names accordingly if necessary.

**Example Output:**

The query might return something like:

```
"gene_id = HOTAIR; transcript_id = ENST00000463982; biotype = protein_coding; strand = +;"
```

In this example, the `strand` attribute for the HOTAIR gene is "+", indicating it's located on the positive strand.
