Here's a breakdown of how to query the database to find the exon count for each BRCA1 transcript isoform, along with a SQL query example:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds information about genomic features like genes and transcripts.  Look for attributes like `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, `featuretype`, and potentially `exon`.
* **Attributes:** The `attributes` column in the `features` table will likely contain key-value pairs describing the feature. You'll need to parse this column to extract exon information.

**SQL Query Example (Conceptual)**

```sql
SELECT 
    transcript_name,  -- Assuming a suitable attribute name for transcript names
    COUNT(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'exon' THEN 1 END) AS exon_count
FROM features
WHERE gene_id = 'BRCA1' -- Replace with the actual BRCA1 gene ID
GROUP BY transcript_name;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT transcript_name, ...`:**  Select the transcript name and calculate the exon count.
2. **`COUNT(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'exon' THEN 1 END)`:** This counts the number of rows where `featuretype` is 'exon'. The `CASE` statement ensures we only count rows representing exons.
3. **`FROM features`:** Specify the table containing your genomic annotation data.
4. **`WHERE gene_id = 'BRCA1'`:** Filter for features associated with the BRCA1 gene. Replace 'BRCA1' with the actual ID from your database.
5. **`GROUP BY transcript_name`:** Group the results by transcript name to get the exon count for each isoform.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Attribute Names:** Adjust attribute names (`transcript_name`, `featuretype`) to match the specific column names in your database schema.
* **Parsing Attributes:** You might need to use string manipulation functions (like `SUBSTRING`, `SPLIT`) within your query to extract values from the `attributes` column if they are not stored as separate columns.
* **Gene ID:** Ensure you have the correct gene ID for BRCA1 in your database.
