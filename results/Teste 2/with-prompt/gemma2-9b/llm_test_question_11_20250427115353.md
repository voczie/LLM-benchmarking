```sql
SELECT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%NFKB1"'
UNION ALL
SELECT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%NFKB2"'
UNION ALL
SELECT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%REL"'
UNION ALL
SELECT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%RELA"'
UNION ALL
SELECT seqid 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%RELB"';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT seqid`**: This selects the chromosome identifier (`seqid`) from the `features` table.
2. **`FROM features`**: Specifies that we are querying the `features` table, which contains genomic feature annotations.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: Filters the results to include only entries representing genes.
4. **`AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"%NFKB1"'` (and similar conditions for other genes)**: This is the key part. It uses the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) to search for the specific gene IDs within the `attributes` column.  The `%"gene_id"%` pattern ensures we're looking for entries where "gene_id" is present as a key-value pair in the attributes.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The exact format of the `attributes` column might vary depending on the GTF/GFF parser used to create the database. Make sure you understand how gene IDs are stored within this column.
* **Case Sensitivity:**  Be mindful of case sensitivity in your queries, especially when comparing strings like gene IDs.
