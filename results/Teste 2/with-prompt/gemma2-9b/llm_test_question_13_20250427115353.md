Here's a breakdown of how to find the biotypes of those genes using SQL queries on your GFF/GTF database:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds the core gene and transcript information.  The `attributes` column is crucial, as it often contains the `biotype` attribute.
* **Parsing Attributes:** The `attributes` column likely stores data in a semicolon-separated format (e.g., "gene_id=ENSG000001234;biotype=protein_coding"). You'll need to split and process this string within your query or using Python/SQL extensions.

**The SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
    f.seqid,  -- Chromosome name
    f.featuretype, -- Gene or transcript type
    SUBSTRING(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'biotype=') + 8) AS biotype
FROM features f
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND (
    f.id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2')
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT` Clause:** We select the chromosome (`seqid`), feature type (`featuretype`), and the `biotype`.
2. **`SUBSTRING` Function:** This extracts the `biotype` value from the `attributes` column. It finds the position of "biotype=" and then takes everything after it up to the next semicolon.
3. **`WHERE` Clause:** Filters for genes with IDs matching your list.

**Important Notes:**

* **Database-Specific Syntax:** Adjust the query slightly if your database uses different syntax (e.g., `INSTR` might be `LOCATE`).
* **Attribute Names:** Double-check that the attribute name is indeed "biotype" in your database. Some databases might use variations like "gene_biotype".
* **Data Processing:** You'll likely need to process the results further (e.g., using Python) to format them neatly or perform additional analysis.
