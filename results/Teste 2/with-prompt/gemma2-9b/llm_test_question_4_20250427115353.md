Here's a breakdown of how to query your SQLite database to find the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10, along with the SQL query:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds information about genomic features like genes.  We'll look for entries where `featuretype` is "gene" and `gene_biotype` (likely found in the `attributes` column) indicates a miRNA gene.
* **`attributes` Column:** This column stores additional information about each feature as key-value pairs. You'll need to examine the format of these attributes to find the specific tag indicating "miRNA".

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '10'  -- Filter for chromosome 10
  AND featuretype = 'gene' -- Select only genes
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "miRNA"%'; -- Find miRNA genes based on attributes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`:** This counts all rows that meet our criteria.
2. **`FROM features`:** We're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE seqid = '10'`:**  This filters for entries on chromosome 10. Remember to adjust this if your database uses a different naming convention for chromosomes.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`:** We only want genes, not other feature types.
5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "miRNA"%'`:** This is the crucial part. It searches for rows where the `attributes` column contains the string `"gene_biotype "miRNA"`. The `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) allows for variations in how this information is stored.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:**  The exact format of the `attributes` column will depend on your GENCODE/Ensembl annotation source. You might need to adjust the `LIKE` clause accordingly.
* **Database Connection:** Before running this query, you'll need to establish a connection to your SQLite database using Python or another suitable language.
