Here's a guide and SQL query to help you generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using your provided database schema:

**1. Data Extraction:**

   - You'll need to query your `features` table to retrieve information about genes located on chromosome X. 

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       gene_id, -- Replace with the actual attribute name for gene ID
       end - start + 1 AS gene_size  -- Calculate gene size (end position - start position + 1)
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'X'  -- Filter for genes on chromosome X
     AND featuretype = 'gene'; -- Filter for gene entries
   ```

**2. Data Visualization:**

   - Once you have the gene IDs and their sizes, you can use a plotting library (like Matplotlib in Python) to create a scatterplot. 

   - **Python Example (using Matplotlib):**

     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     # Assuming your SQL query results are stored in a pandas DataFrame called 'df'
     plt.scatter(df['gene_id'], df['gene_size'])  
     plt.xlabel('Gene ID')
     plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
     plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
     plt.show() 
     ```

**Important Considerations:**

   - **Attribute Names:** Replace `gene_id` and other attribute names in the SQL query with the actual column names from your database schema.
   - **Data Handling:**  You'll need to process the results of your SQL query into a suitable format (e.g., a pandas DataFrame) for plotting in Python.
