Here's a breakdown of how to approach this query using SQLite and the provided schema.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find genes that fall within the genomic region between *HOXC11* and *HOXC12*.  The challenge is that:

* **Gene order isn't directly represented:** The database doesn't explicitly store gene relationships like "gene A precedes gene B."
* **Strand matters:** We need to consider both the positive (+) and negative (-) strands.

**Solution Approach**

1. **Identify HOXC11 and HOXC12 Locations:**  Start by querying the `features` table for the start and end positions of *HOXC11* and *HOXC12*. You'll need to know their gene IDs (likely found in the `id` column).

2. **Define a Genomic Region:** Based on the locations of *HOXC11* and *HOXC12*, define a range of genomic coordinates that encompass the region between them.  Remember to account for both strands (+ and -).

3. **Query for Genes Within the Region:** Use an SQL query to select genes from the `features` table whose start and end positions fall within your defined genomic region. You'll need to filter by strand as well.

**SQL Query Example (Conceptual)**

```sql
-- Find HOXC11 and HOXC12 locations
SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11_gene_id' 
UNION ALL
SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12_gene_id';

-- Define the region between them (adjust values based on results above)
DECLARE @start INT = 10000; -- Start position of HOXC11
DECLARE @end INT = 20000;  -- End position of HOXC12

-- Query for genes within the region
SELECT * FROM features
WHERE start BETWEEN @start AND @end
AND strand IN ('+', '-')
ORDER BY start, end;
```

**Important Notes:**

* **Replace placeholders:** Substitute `'HOXC11_gene_id'` and `'HOXC12_gene_id'` with the actual gene IDs from your database. Adjust `@start` and `@end` based on the results of your first query.
* **Strand filtering:** The `strand IN ('+', '-')` clause ensures you retrieve genes on both strands.
* **Database-specific syntax:**  The exact syntax might vary slightly depending on your SQLite version.
