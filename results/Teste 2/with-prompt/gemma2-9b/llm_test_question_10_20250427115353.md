```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"% "BRCA1"' ;
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **`SELECT seqid, start, end`**: This part specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the `features` table:
   - `seqid`: The chromosome name (e.g., 'chr17').
   - `start`: The starting position of the gene on the chromosome.
   - `end`: The ending position of the gene on the chromosome.

2. **`FROM features`**: This indicates the table you're querying, which is `features`.

3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: This filters the results to include only entries representing genes.

4. **`AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_id"% "BRCA1"'`**: This is a crucial part for finding the specific BRCA1 gene. It uses the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) to search within the `attributes` column.  
   - The pattern `%"gene_id"% "BRCA1"` looks for entries where the `attributes` string contains `"gene_id"`, followed by a space, and then the value `"BRCA1"`.

**Important Notes:**

- **Attribute Format**: GTF/GFF files often store attributes as key-value pairs within the `attributes` column. The exact format might vary depending on the annotation source (Ensembl in this case).
- **Database Connection**: Before executing this query, you'll need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database using Python or another suitable tool.
