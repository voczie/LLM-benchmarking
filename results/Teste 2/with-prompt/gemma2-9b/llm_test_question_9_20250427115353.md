Here's a breakdown of how to find the average exon size of BRCA1 transcript isoforms using SQL and the provided database schema.

**Understanding the Problem**

* **BRCA1 Transcript Isoforms:**  BRCA1 is a gene with multiple transcript variants (isoforms). Each isoform has its own set of exons.
* **Exon Size:** We need to determine the length of each exon within these isoforms.
* **Average Exon Size:** Finally, we'll calculate the average size of all exons across all BRCA1 transcript isoforms.

**SQL Query Walkthrough**

```sql
-- 1. Identify BRCA1 transcripts
SELECT id
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr17' -- Assuming BRCA1 is on chromosome 17
  AND featuretype = 'transcript'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%';

-- 2. Find exons associated with each transcript
SELECT f.start, f.end
FROM features AS f
JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr17' AND featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%')
  AND f.featuretype = 'exon';

-- 3. Calculate exon sizes
SELECT (f.end - f.start) AS exon_size
FROM features AS f
JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr17' AND featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%')
  AND f.featuretype = 'exon';

-- 4. Calculate the average exon size
SELECT AVG(exon_size) AS average_exon_size
FROM (
    SELECT (f.end - f.start) AS exon_size
    FROM features AS f
    JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
    WHERE r.parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr17' AND featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%')
      AND f.featuretype = 'exon'
) AS exon_sizes;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify BRCA1 Transcripts:** This subquery selects the IDs of all transcripts on chromosome 17 that are associated with the gene BRCA1.
2. **Find Exons:** This subquery uses the `relations` table to link exons (feature type 'exon') to their parent transcripts (identified in step 1).
3. **Calculate Exon Sizes:**  This subquery calculates the size of each exon by subtracting the start position from the end position.
4. **Average Exon Size:** This final query uses the `AVG()` function to calculate the average exon size across all exons found in step 3.

**Important Notes:**

* **Chromosome ID:** Replace 'chr17' with the actual chromosome where BRCA1 is located if it's different.
* **Attribute Matching:** The `LIKE` operator is used for approximate matching of attributes. You might need to adjust the pattern (`%gene_id "BRCA1"%`) based on the specific format of attribute values in your database.
