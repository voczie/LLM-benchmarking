Here's a breakdown of how to find the number of transcript isoforms for the XIST gene and their sizes using the provided schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    transcript_id,  -- Transcript ID
    SUM(end - start + 1) AS transcript_size -- Calculate size based on start and end coordinates
FROM features
WHERE 
    gene_id = 'XIST' -- Filter for features associated with the XIST gene
GROUP BY 
    transcript_id
ORDER BY 
    transcript_size DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT transcript_id, SUM(end - start + 1) AS transcript_size`**:  We select the `transcript_id` and calculate the size of each transcript isoform using the formula `(end - start + 1)`. This gives us the total number of base pairs in each transcript.

2. **`FROM features`**: We query the `features` table, which contains information about genomic features like genes and transcripts.

3. **`WHERE gene_id = 'XIST'`**:  We filter the results to include only features associated with the gene 'XIST'. Replace 'XIST' with the actual ID if it differs.

4. **`GROUP BY transcript_id`**: We group the results by `transcript_id` so that we get a separate row for each unique transcript isoform of the XIST gene.

5. **`ORDER BY transcript_size DESC`**:  We order the results in descending order based on `transcript_size`, so the largest isoforms appear first.



**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Names:** Make sure the attribute names (`gene_id`, `transcript_id`, `start`, `end`) match the actual column names in your database schema.
* **Database Connection:** You'll need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database before executing this query.
