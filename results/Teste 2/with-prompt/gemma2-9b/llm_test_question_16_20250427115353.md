```sql
SELECT 
    f.seqid AS chromosome,
    f.start AS start_position,
    f.end AS end_position,
    (f.end - f.start + 1) AS transcript_size,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.child) AS num_exons,
    AVG(r.child - r.parent) AS avg_exon_size,
    f.strand,
    t.gene_biotype
FROM features f
JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.parent
JOIN features t ON f.id = t.id
WHERE t.gene_id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'COL1A2', 'HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12')
GROUP BY f.id, f.seqid, f.start, f.end, f.strand, t.gene_biotype
ORDER BY t.gene_id, f.seqid;

```

**Explanation:**

1. **SELECT Clause:** We select the desired information: chromosome (seqid), start and end positions, transcript size, number of exons, average exon size, strand, and biotype.

2. **FROM Clause:** We join three tables:
   - `features` (f): Contains general feature information like ID, sequence ID, type, etc.
   - `relations` (r): Defines relationships between features, specifically parent-child for exons.
   - `features` (t): Contains gene-specific attributes like biotype.

3. **JOIN Conditions:**
   - `f.id = r.parent`: Links the transcript feature to its exon children.
   - `f.id = t.id`: Links the transcript feature to its gene information.

4. **WHERE Clause:** Filters for transcripts belonging to the specified genes: 'XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'COL1A2', 'HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', and 'HOXC12'.

5. **GROUP BY Clause:** Groups results by transcript ID, chromosome, start position, end position, strand, and biotype to calculate aggregate values like size and average exon size.

6. **ORDER BY Clause:** Sorts the results by gene ID and then chromosome for easier readability.



**Saving the Results:**
You can save the query results to a file using tools provided by your database client or programming language. For example, in Python with sqlite3:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute(your_sql_query)
results = cursor.fetchall()

with open('transcript_info.txt', 'w') as f:
    for row in results:
        f.write(f"{row[0]} | {row[1]} | {row[2]} | {row[3]} | {row[4]} | {row[5]} | {row[6]} | {row[7]}\n")

conn.close()
```



Remember to replace `your_database.db` with the actual path to your database file and adjust the code according to your specific environment and requirements.
