Here's a breakdown of how to query your SQLite database to find the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12, along with the SQL query itself:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds information about genomic features like genes.  We're interested in the `featuretype` column to identify genes and the `gene_biotype` attribute within the `attributes` column to filter for protein-coding genes.
* **Attributes:** GTF/GFF attributes are often stored as comma-separated strings. You'll need to parse these strings to extract the `gene_biotype`.

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '12' 
  AND featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "protein_coding"%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet our criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**: We're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE seqid = '12'`**:  Filters for features on chromosome 12.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**: Ensures we're only counting genes.
5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype "protein_coding"%'`**: This is the key part. It uses a `LIKE` clause to search for the string `"gene_biotype "protein_coding"` within the `attributes` column. The `%` wildcard allows for variations in attribute formatting.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Parsing:**  The `LIKE` clause assumes a consistent format for attributes. If attribute formats vary, you might need more complex parsing techniques (e.g., using regular expressions or splitting on commas).
* **Database Schema:** Adjust the table and column names if they differ from the example schema provided.
