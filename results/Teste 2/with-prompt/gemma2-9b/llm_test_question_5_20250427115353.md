Here's a breakdown of how to calculate the sizes of those gene loci using SQL queries on your Ensembl GFF/GTF database:

**Understanding the Schema**

* **`features` Table:** This is your primary table containing information about genomic features (genes, transcripts, etc.).  The `start` and `end` columns define the coordinates of each feature.
* **`id` Column:** A unique identifier for each feature in the database.

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT 
    gene_id, -- Assuming 'gene_id' is the attribute holding gene names
    (end - start + 1) AS locus_size  -- Calculate size by subtracting start from end and adding 1
FROM features
WHERE gene_id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'COL1A2', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB')
ORDER BY gene_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT gene_id, (end - start + 1) AS locus_size`:**  We select the `gene_id` and calculate the size of each locus using `(end - start + 1)`. Adding 1 ensures we include the last base pair.
2. **`FROM features`:** We specify that our data comes from the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE gene_id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', ..., 'RELB')`:** This filters the results to only include genes with the specified IDs.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Names:** Adjust `gene_id` if the attribute holding gene names is different in your database.
* **Chromosome Information:** If you need chromosome information alongside the size, add `seqid` to your `SELECT` statement.
