Here's how you can find the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 using SQL and the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '7' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND gene_biotype = 'lncRNA';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet the specified criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**:  We are querying the `features` table, which contains information about genomic features.
3. **`WHERE seqid = '7'`**: This filters for features located on chromosome 7. Remember that Ensembl uses numerical or letter-based chromosome identifiers (e.g., '7', 'X', 'Y').
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**:  This further restricts the results to entries classified as genes.
5. **`AND gene_biotype = 'lncRNA'`**: This final condition selects only those genes annotated as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Names:** The specific attribute names (`gene_biotype`) might vary slightly depending on the GENCODE or Ensembl release you are using. Refer to the documentation for your specific annotation source to confirm the exact attribute names.
* **Case Sensitivity:** SQL keywords and attribute names are often case-insensitive, but it's best practice to maintain consistency in your queries.
