Here's a breakdown of how to query the database for the number of pseudogenes on chromosome X, along with the SQL query:

**Understanding the Data**

* **`features` Table:** This table holds information about genomic features like genes and pseudogenes.  We'll focus on the `featuretype` column to identify pseudogenes.
* **`attributes` Column:** This column stores additional information about each feature in a structured format (likely key-value pairs). We'll need to parse this to find relevant attributes.

**SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype LIKE '%pseudogene%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`:** This counts all rows that meet our criteria.
2. **`FROM features`:** We're querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'X'`:**  This filters for features located on chromosome X.
4. **`AND featuretype LIKE '%pseudogene%'`:** This further filters for rows where the `featuretype` column contains the substring "pseudogene". The `%` wildcard allows for variations in pseudogene types (e.g., 'processed_pseudogene', 'unitary_pseudogene').

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Parsing:**  The query assumes that the `featuretype` column directly indicates whether a feature is a pseudogene. If attributes are stored differently, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.
* **Database Schema:** Make sure your database schema matches the provided example.
