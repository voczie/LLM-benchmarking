To determine the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 from the provided SQLite database schema, you can execute SQL queries that count the occurrences of the relevant feature types in the `features` table. 

In GFF/GTF formats, genes and transcripts are typically represented by specific feature types. Commonly, the feature type for genes is "gene" and for transcripts is "mRNA" or "transcript". 

Here’s a step-by-step guide to construct the necessary SQL queries:

### Step 1: Count the Number of Genes

To count the number of genes on chromosome 3, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Step 2: Count the Number of Transcripts

To count the number of transcripts on chromosome 3, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript');
```

### Step 3: Combine the Results

If you want to combine the results into a single query, you can use a `UNION` or a `JOIN`. However, since you are counting separately, it might be clearer to run the two queries independently and then combine the results in your application logic.

### Example of Combined Query

If you prefer to get both counts in a single query, you can use a `CASE` statement:

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'gene' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS gene_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS transcript_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3';
```

### Step 4: Execute the Queries

You can execute these queries using a SQLite client or through a programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). 

### Example in Python

Here’s a simple example of how you might execute the combined query in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the combined query
query = """
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN featuretype = 'gene' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS gene_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS transcript_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3';
"""

cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Print the results
print(f"Number of genes on chromosome 3: {result[0]}")
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: {result[1]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will be able to determine the number of genes and transcripts present on chromosome 3 in your SQLite database containing genome annotations.
