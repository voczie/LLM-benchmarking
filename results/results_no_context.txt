To determine the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 from the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to query the `features` table, which contains the genomic features including genes and transcripts. 

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Identify Feature Types**: First, you need to know the feature types that correspond to genes and transcripts. Typically, in GFF/GTF files:
   - Genes are often labeled as `gene`.
   - Transcripts are often labeled as `mRNA` or `transcript`.

2. **Construct SQL Queries**: You will need to write SQL queries to count the number of genes and transcripts specifically on chromosome 3.

3. **Execute Queries**: You will execute the queries against the SQLite database.

### SQL Queries

Here are the SQL queries you can use:

1. **Count Genes on Chromosome 3**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
   ```

2. **Count Transcripts on Chromosome 3**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript');
   ```

### Combined Query (Optional)

If you want to get both counts in a single query, you can use a `UNION` or a `CASE` statement. Hereâ€™s an example using `UNION`:

```sql
SELECT 'gene' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene'
GROUP BY feature_type

UNION ALL

SELECT 'transcript' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript')
GROUP BY feature_type;
```

### Execution

1. Open your SQLite database using a command-line interface or a database management tool.
2. Run the above SQL queries to get the counts of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.

### Interpretation of Results

- The result of the first query will give you the number of genes on chromosome 3.
- The result of the second query will give you the number of transcripts on chromosome 3.
- If you used the combined query, you will get both counts in a single result set.

Make sure to replace `'chr3'` with the exact identifier used in your database if it differs (e.g., it might be `3` or `chr03`).
