To determine how many miRNA genes exist on chromosome 10 using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Database Schema**: The `features` table contains all genomic features, including genes and their types (e.g., protein-coding, miRNA). Each feature has attributes stored in a text format.

2. **Identify Relevant Features**:
   - You need to filter for features of type `'gene'`.
   - Within these gene features, identify those with an attribute indicating they are miRNA genes. This is typically found in the `attributes` column, which might contain key-value pairs like `"gene_type" "miRNA"`.

3. **Filter by Chromosome**:
   - You need to filter these miRNA genes to only include those on chromosome 10. This can be done using the `seqid` column.

4. **SQL Query Construction**:
   - Use an SQL query to extract and count the relevant features based on the above criteria.

Here is a step-by-step SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_gene_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND seqid = '10'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type "miRNA"%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_gene_count`: This counts all rows that match the criteria and labels the result as `miRNA_gene_count`.
- `FROM features`: Specifies the table to query.
- `WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`: Filters for gene features.
- `AND seqid = '10'`: Ensures only genes on chromosome 10 are considered.
- `AND attributes LIKE '%gene_type "miRNA"%';`: Checks if the `attributes` column contains a key-value pair indicating the gene is of type miRNA.

### Execution:
- Run this query in an SQLite environment where your database is loaded. The result will give you the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.

This approach assumes that the `attributes` field uses a consistent format for storing gene types, which is common in GFF/GTF files. Adjust the attribute key if necessary based on the specific annotation file's conventions.
