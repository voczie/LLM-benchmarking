To find genes located between the `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` genes on both the positive (+) and negative (-) strands, we can follow these steps using SQL queries. We'll assume that the database is already loaded with the genome annotation data.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify the Positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12:**
   - First, retrieve the start and end positions for both `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.

2. **Determine Strand Orientation:**
   - Check the strand orientation (`+` or `-`) for each gene.

3. **Query Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12:**
   - Depending on the strand, determine which genes are located between these two genes.

### SQL Queries

#### Step 1: Retrieve Positions and Strands

```sql
-- Get positions and strands for HOXC11 and HOXC12
SELECT id, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (id = 'HOXC11' OR id = 'HOXC12');
```

#### Step 2: Query Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12

- **For the Positive Strand (+):**

```sql
-- Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the positive strand
SELECT f.id, f.start, f.end, f.strand 
FROM features AS f
JOIN (
    SELECT start AS hoxc11_start, end AS hoxc11_end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11'
) AS h11 ON 1=1
JOIN (
    SELECT start AS hoxc12_start, end AS hoxc12_end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12'
) AS h12 ON 1=1
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' 
AND f.strand = '+' 
AND ((f.start > h11.hoxc11_end AND f.end < h12.hoxc12_start) OR (f.start > h12.hoxc12_end AND f.end < h11.hoxc11_start));
```

- **For the Negative Strand (-):**

```sql
-- Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the negative strand
SELECT f.id, f.start, f.end, f.strand 
FROM features AS f
JOIN (
    SELECT start AS hoxc11_start, end AS hoxc11_end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11'
) AS h11 ON 1=1
JOIN (
    SELECT start AS hoxc12_start, end AS hoxc12_end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12'
) AS h12 ON 1=1
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' 
AND f.strand = '-' 
AND ((f.start < h11.hoxc11_start AND f.end > h11.hoxc11_end) OR (f.start < h12.hoxc12_start AND f.end > h12.hoxc12_end));
```

### Explanation

- **Positive Strand (+):** For genes on the positive strand, we look for genes that start after `HOXC11` ends and end before `HOXC12` starts, or vice versa.
  
- **Negative Strand (-):** For genes on the negative strand, we look for genes that start before `HOXC11` starts and end after `HOXC11` ends, or similarly with `HOXC12`.

These queries will give you a list of genes located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands. Adjust the logic if your genome annotation has specific requirements or additional constraints.
