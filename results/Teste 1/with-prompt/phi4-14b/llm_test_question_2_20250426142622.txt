To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are located on chromosome 7 using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Database Schema**: The `features` table contains all genomic features, including genes. Each feature has attributes stored in a text format.

2. **Identify Relevant Features**:
   - We need to filter for features of type `'gene'`.
   - Within these gene features, we are interested in those with a `gene_biotype` attribute that includes `'lncRNA'`.

3. **Filter by Chromosome**: 
   - We want only genes located on chromosome 7, which corresponds to the `seqid` field.

4. **SQL Query**:
   - Use an SQL query to extract and count these specific features from the database.

Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND seqid = '7'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype%lncRNA%'
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count`: This part counts all rows that match the criteria and labels the result as `lncRNA_count`.
- `FROM features`: Specifies the table to query.
- `WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`: Filters for gene features.
- `AND seqid = '7'`: Ensures we are only looking at genes on chromosome 7.
- `AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype%lncRNA%'`: Checks if the `attributes` field contains `'gene_biotype lncRNA'`. The `%` symbols allow for any characters before or after this substring, accommodating different attribute formats.

### Running the Query:
To execute this query, you would typically use a Python script with an SQLite connection. Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('path_to_your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND seqid = '7'
  AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype%lncRNA%'
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will output the number of lncRNA genes located on chromosome 7.
