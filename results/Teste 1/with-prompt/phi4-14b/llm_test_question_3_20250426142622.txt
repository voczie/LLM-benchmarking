To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Use a Python script with `sqlite3` to connect to your database.

2. **Query for Pseudogenes on Chromosome X**:
   - You need to query the `features` table to find entries where the `featuretype` is 'pseudogene' and the `seqid` (chromosome identifier) is 'X'.

Here's a Python script that performs this task:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_file.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to count pseudogenes on chromosome X
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of pseudogenes on chromosome X: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation:

- **Connection**: The script connects to your SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
  
- **Query Execution**: It executes a SQL query that counts all entries in the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'pseudogene' and the `seqid` is 'X'.

- **Result Fetching**: The result of the query, which is the count of pseudogenes on chromosome X, is fetched using `cursor.fetchone()`.

- **Output**: Finally, it prints out the number of pseudogenes found on chromosome X.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_file.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This script will give you the exact count of pseudogenes located on the X chromosome based on the data stored in your database.
