### Explanation:

1. **Database Connection**: Connect to the SQLite database containing genome annotation data.

2. **Function `avg_exon_size_of_transcript`**:
   - This function calculates the average exon size for a given transcript.
   - It queries all exons related to the specified transcript using SQL joins between the `features` and `relations` tables.
   - Exon lengths are calculated by subtracting the start position from the end position (inclusive).
   - The average of these lengths is computed.

3. **Retrieve BRCA1 Transcripts**:
   - A query retrieves all transcript isoforms associated with the BRCA1 gene using a LIKE condition on the `attributes` field to match the gene ID.

4. **Calculate Average Exon Sizes**:
   - For each BRCA1 transcript, calculate its average exon size.
   - Compute the overall average exon size across all transcripts.

5. **Output**: Print the calculated average exon size for BRCA1 transcript isoforms.

6. **Close Connection**: Ensure the database connection is closed after operations are complete.
