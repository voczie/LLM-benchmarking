To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite database.

2. **Query for the BRCA1 Gene:**
   You need to query the `features` table to find the entry corresponding to the BRCA1 gene. The `attributes` column will contain key-value pairs where one of the keys should be `gene_name`.

3. **Extract Chromosomal Position:**
   Once you have identified the BRCA1 gene, extract its chromosomal position using the `seqid`, `start`, and `end` columns.

### SQL Query

Here's a sample Python script to perform these steps:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to find the BRCA1 gene
query = """
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name "BRCA1"%';
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Check if a result was found
if result:
    chromosomal_position = {
        'Chromosome': result[0],
        'Start Position': result[1],
        'End Position': result[2]
    }
    print(f"BRCA1 Gene Chromosomal Position: {chromosomal_position}")
else:
    print("BRCA1 gene not found in the database.")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Connection:** The script connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
  
- **Query Execution:** It executes an SQL query that searches for a feature of type 'gene' with an attribute containing `gene_name "BRCA1"`. This assumes the attributes are stored in a format like `key "value"`.

- **Result Handling:** The script fetches the first result using `fetchone()`, which should contain the chromosomal position if BRCA1 is present.

- **Output:** It prints the chromosome, start, and end positions of the BRCA1 gene.

### Notes

- Ensure your database file path (`your_database_name.db`) is correct.
- The attributes column format might vary; adjust the query if necessary to match your specific attribute storage format.
- This script assumes that `gene_name` is stored in a consistent manner within the `attributes` text field. Adjust the LIKE pattern if needed based on actual data formatting.

This approach will help you determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene efficiently using SQL queries and Python.
