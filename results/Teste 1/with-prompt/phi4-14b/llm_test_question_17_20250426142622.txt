### Explanation:

1. **Database Connection**: Connect to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - Define a function `get_gene_lengths` that takes a chromosome identifier as an argument.
   - Use SQL to query genes on the specified chromosome from the `features` table where `featuretype='gene'`.
   - Calculate each gene's length by subtracting its start position from its end position and adding 1 (to account for inclusive indexing).

3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Execute the query with the specific chromosome ('X') to get all genes on that chromosome.
   - Fetch all results and calculate their lengths.

4. **Plotting**:
   - Use `matplotlib` to create a scatter plot of gene indices versus their lengths.
   - Set appropriate labels for the axes and title for clarity.

5. **Close Connection**: Close the database connection after retrieving data to free resources.

This script will generate a scatterplot showing how gene sizes are distributed across chromosome X, providing insights into the variability in gene length on this chromosome.
