To determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene in your genome annotation database, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Query for the BRCA1 Gene

First, we need to find the specific entry for the BRCA1 gene. We will use the `features` table and filter by the gene name or ID.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
db = conn.cursor()

# Query for the BRCA1 gene
brca1_query = """
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
"""

# Execute the query
db.execute(brca1_query)
result = db.fetchone()
conn.close()

if result:
    chromosome, start, end, strand = result
    print(f"BRCA1 gene is located on {chromosome} from position {start} to {end}. The strand is {strand}.")
else:
    print("BRCA1 gene not found.")
```

### Step 2: Verify the Gene Attributes

If you have more detailed attributes stored in the `attributes` column, you can parse them to ensure that BRCA1 is correctly identified. For example:

```python
import json

# Parse the attributes JSON string
def get_attribute(attributes_str, key):
    try:
        attributes = json.loads(attributes_str)
        return attributes.get(key)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing attributes: {e}")
        return None

# Query for BRCA1 gene with detailed attribute checking
brca1_query_detailed = """
SELECT seqid, start, end, strand, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene';
"""

db.execute(brca1_query_detailed)
results = db.fetchall()

for row in results:
    chromosome, start, end, strand, attributes_str = row
    gene_id = get_attribute(attributes_str, "ID")
    gene_name = get_attribute(attributes_str, "Name")

    if gene_name == 'BRCA1':
        print(f"BRCA1 gene is located on {chromosome} from position {start} to {end}. The strand is {strand}. Gene ID: {gene_id}")
```

### Step 3: Use Biopython for Parsing Attributes (Optional)

If you are using a more complex GFF/GTF format and need to parse attributes in a structured way, consider using the `Biopython` library:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Assuming your database is stored as a file
for record in SeqIO.parse("your_annotation_file.gtf", "gtf"):
    if 'gene_name' in record.qualifiers and record.qualifiers['gene_name'][0] == 'BRCA1':
        print(f"BRCA1 gene is located on {record.id} from position {record.start + 1} to {record.end}. The strand is {record.strand}")
```

### Step 4: Plotting the Position (Optional)

If you want to visualize the BRCA1 gene's location, you can use matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming we have the chromosome and positions from previous steps
chromosome = "chr17"
start_pos = 43044295
end_pos = 43125334

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 1))
plt.fill_between([start_pos, end_pos], [0.5], [1.5], color='blue')
plt.title(f"BRCA1 gene location on {chromosome}")
plt.xlabel("Chromosome Position")
plt.yticks([])
plt.show()
```

### Summary

By following these steps, you can accurately determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene in your genome annotation database and visualize its location if needed. Adjust the queries based on the specific structure and content of your database schema.
