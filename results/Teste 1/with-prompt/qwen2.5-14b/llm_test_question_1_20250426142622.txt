To determine how many protein-coding genes are on chromosome 12, you can use the SQLite database schema provided and query it using Python with the `sqlite3` module or a more convenient ORM like SQLAlchemy. Below is an example of how to achieve this using Python and the `sqlite3` module.

First, ensure that your genome annotation data is loaded into the SQLite database as described in the schema. Then, you can write a script to query the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Connect to the Database
Connect to the SQLite database using Python and the `sqlite3` module.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

### Step 2: Query for Protein-Coding Genes on Chromosome 12
Write a query to count the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12. The `features` table contains information about each feature, and you can filter by `featuretype`, `seqid`, and attributes.

```python
# SQL query to count protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12'
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND 'protein_coding' IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(attributes) WHERE key = 'gene_biotype');
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"Number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12: {result}")
```

### Step 3: Close the Database Connection
After fetching the results, close the database connection.

```python
conn.close()
```

### Full Script Example

Here is a complete script that connects to the SQLite database and queries for the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# SQL query to count protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12'
AND featuretype = 'gene'
AND 'protein_coding' IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(attributes) WHERE key = 'gene_biotype');
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()[0]

print(f"Number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12: {result}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **`seqid = 'chr12'`**: Filters features to only those located on chromosome 12.
- **`featuretype = 'gene'`**: Ensures that we are counting genes, not other types of features like transcripts or exons.
- **`AND 'protein_coding' IN (SELECT value FROM json_each(attributes) WHERE key = 'gene_biotype')`**: This part checks if the gene is protein-coding by looking for the `gene_biotype` attribute in the JSON-formatted attributes column.

This script will output the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12. Adjust the database file path and other parameters as necessary to fit your specific setup.
