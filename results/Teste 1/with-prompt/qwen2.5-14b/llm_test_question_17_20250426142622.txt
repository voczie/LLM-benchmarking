To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome, we need to follow these steps:

1. Retrieve all genes located on the X chromosome from the database.
2. Calculate the size (length) of each gene.
3. Collect the lengths in a list.
4. Use matplotlib to create a scatter plot.

Here's how you can achieve this step-by-step using Python and the `sqlite3` library:

```python
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
db = conn.cursor()

def get_gene_lengths(chromosome):
    # Query all genes on the specified chromosome
    db.execute("SELECT id, start, end FROM features WHERE seqid=? AND featuretype='gene'", (chromosome,))
    
    gene_lengths = []
    for row in db.fetchall():
        gene_id, start, end = row
        length = end - start + 1  # Calculate the length of the gene
        gene_lengths.append(length)
        
    return gene_lengths

# Get gene lengths on chromosome X
gene_lengths_x = get_gene_lengths('X')

# Create a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of gene sizes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(range(len(gene_lengths_x)), gene_lengths_x, alpha=0.5)
plt.title("Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X")
plt.xlabel("Gene Index")
plt.ylabel("Gene Length (bp)")
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Database Connection**: Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
2. **Query Genes on Chromosome X**:
   - Use an SQL query to fetch all genes located on chromosome 'X'.
3. **Calculate Gene Lengths**:
   - For each gene, calculate the length by subtracting the start position from the end position and adding 1 (since both positions are inclusive).
4. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Create a scatter plot using `matplotlib` to visualize the distribution of gene sizes.
   - The x-axis represents the index of genes in the list, while the y-axis shows the length of each gene.

This script will generate a scatterplot that visualizes how gene lengths are distributed across chromosome X. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or additional analysis needs.
