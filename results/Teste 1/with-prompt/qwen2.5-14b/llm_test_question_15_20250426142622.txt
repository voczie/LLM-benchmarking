To find which genes are located between the `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` genes on both the positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes**.
2. **Retrieve all genes that lie within this range for each strand**.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this using Python with SQLite3 database operations:

### Step 1: Identify Positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 Genes

First, you need to find the start and end positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
db = conn.cursor()

def get_gene_positions(gene_name):
    db.execute("SELECT seqid, strand, start, end FROM features WHERE id = ?", (gene_name,))
    return db.fetchone()

hoxc11_pos = get_gene_positions('HOXC11')
hoxc12_pos = get_gene_positions('HOXC12')

print(f"HOXC11: {hoxc11_pos}")
print(f"HOXC12: {hoxc12_pos}")

conn.close()
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Genes Between HOXC11 and HOXC12

Now, you need to retrieve all genes that lie between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands.

```python
def get_genes_between(hoxc11_pos, hoxc12_pos):
    seqid = hoxc11_pos[0]
    
    # Ensure HOXC11 is the start gene for comparison
    if hoxc11_pos[3] < hoxc12_pos[3]:
        start_gene = hoxc11_pos
        end_gene = hoxc12_pos
    else:
        start_gene = hoxc12_pos
        end_gene = hoxc11_pos
    
    # Query genes between the two positions on both strands
    db.execute("SELECT id, seqid, strand, start, end FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = ? AND (strand = '+' AND start BETWEEN ? AND ?) OR (strand = '-' AND end BETWEEN ? AND ?)", 
               (seqid, start_gene[2], end_gene[3], start_gene[2], end_gene[3]))
    
    genes_between = db.fetchall()
    
    return genes_between

# Reconnect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
db = conn.cursor()

genes_between_pos_strand = get_genes_between(hoxc11_pos, hoxc12_pos)
genes_between_neg_strand = []

if hoxc11_pos[1] == '-' and hoxc12_pos[1] == '-':
    genes_between_neg_strand = get_genes_between(hoxc12_pos, hoxc11_pos)

print("Genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on + strand:")
for gene in genes_between_pos_strand:
    print(gene)
    
if genes_between_neg_strand:
    print("\nGenes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on - strand:")
    for gene in genes_between_neg_strand:
        print(gene)

conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: The `get_gene_positions` function fetches the positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.
- **Step 2**: The `get_genes_between` function queries all genes between the two given genes on both strands. It ensures that the start gene is always before the end gene for comparison.
  
### Output

The output will list all genes located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands.

This approach ensures you accurately retrieve the required information from your genome annotation database.
