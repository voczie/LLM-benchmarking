To determine the strand on which the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located, you can follow these steps:

1. Query the database to find the features corresponding to these gene names.
2. Extract the `strand` attribute for each of these genes.

Here's a step-by-step guide using Python with the SQLite3 database:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
db = conn.cursor()

# Function to get the strand of a gene by its name
def get_strand_of_gene(gene_name):
    query = f"SELECT attributes FROM features WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE '%{gene_name}%'"
    db.execute(query)
    result = db.fetchone()
    
    if result:
        # Parse the attributes to extract the strand information
        attributes = result[0]
        for attr in attributes.split(';'):
            if 'strand' in attr:
                return attr.split('=')[1]
    else:
        return None

# List of genes to check
genes_to_check = ['HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12']

# Dictionary to store the strand information for each gene
gene_strand_info = {}

for gene in genes_to_check:
    strand = get_strand_of_gene(gene)
    if strand is not None:
        gene_strand_info[gene] = strand

# Print the results
print("Gene\tStrand")
for gene, strand in gene_strand_info.items():
    print(f"{gene}\t{strand}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Establish a connection to your SQLite3 database.
2. **Query for Gene Attributes**: Construct a query to find features of type `gene` that contain the gene names in their attributes.
3. **Parse Attributes**: For each gene found, parse the `attributes` field to extract the strand information.
4. **Store and Print Results**: Store the strand information in a dictionary and print it out.

### Notes:
- The query assumes that the gene name is included as part of the `attributes` field in the format `gene_id=gene_name`.
- If your database uses a different schema or attribute naming convention, you may need to adjust the parsing logic accordingly.
- Ensure that the connection to the database and cursor are properly closed after use.

This script will output the strand information for each gene if they exist in the database.
