To determine how many lncRNA genes are present on chromosome 7, you can use the SQLite database schema provided. The `features` table contains information about all features in the genome annotation, including gene types such as lncRNA.

Here's a step-by-step guide to query the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7:

1. **Identify the relevant feature type and attributes**: You need to filter for genes that are specifically annotated as lncRNAs.
2. **Filter by chromosome**: Restrict the search to chromosome 7.

Here's how you can write a SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_lncrna_genes
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%'
AND seqid = '7';
```

This query will count all genes on chromosome 7 that are annotated as lncRNAs.

### Python Code Implementation

To execute this SQL query using Python and the SQLite database, you can use the `sqlite3` module. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_file.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the SQL query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_lncrna_genes
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%'
AND seqid = '7';
"""

# Execute the query and fetch the result
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

1. **Connecting to the Database**: The `sqlite3.connect` function is used to connect to your SQLite database file.
2. **Executing the Query**: The SQL query is executed using `cursor.execute`.
3. **Fetching and Printing the Result**: The result of the query (the count) is fetched using `fetchone()[0]`, which retrieves the first column of the first row returned by the query.
4. **Closing the Connection**: Finally, the connection to the database is closed.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_file.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.

This approach ensures that you accurately count the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 using the provided genome annotation data stored in a SQLite database.
