To determine how many genes for miRNA exist in chromosome 10, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Genes**: First, identify all features of type 'gene' on chromosome 10.
2. **Filter by Gene Type**: Filter the identified genes to find those that are specifically annotated as miRNA.

Here's a step-by-step guide and Python code using SQLite3 and the `sqlite` module in Python:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
   
2. **Query for Genes on Chromosome 10**:
   - Use SQL queries to fetch all genes located on chromosome 10.

3. **Filter by miRNA Type**:
   - Filter these genes based on their attributes to find those that are specifically annotated as miRNA.

### Python Code

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
db = conn.cursor()

# Query for all genes on chromosome 10
query_genes_on_chromosome_10 = """
SELECT id, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = '10' AND featuretype = 'gene';
"""

# Execute the query and fetch results
genes_on_chromosome_10 = db.execute(query_genes_on_chromosome_10).fetchall()

# Filter genes to find miRNA genes
miRNA_gene_count = 0

for gene in genes_on_chromosome_10:
    gene_id, attributes_str = gene
    # Parse the attributes string into a dictionary
    attributes_dict = dict(item.split("=") for item in attributes_str.split(";") if "=" in item)
    
    # Check if the gene is annotated as miRNA
    if 'gene_biotype' in attributes_dict and attributes_dict['gene_biotype'] == 'miRNA':
        miRNA_gene_count += 1

# Print the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10
print(f"Number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10: {miRNA_gene_count}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Connection**: Establish a connection to your SQLite database.
- **Query Execution**: Execute a query to fetch all genes located on chromosome 10.
- **Attribute Parsing**: Parse the attributes string of each gene to extract the `gene_biotype`.
- **Filtering**: Check if the `gene_biotype` is 'miRNA' and count such genes.

### Notes

- Ensure that your database file path (`your_database.db`) is correct.
- The attribute parsing assumes a specific format for the attributes field. Adjust the parsing logic if necessary based on the actual structure of your data.

This approach will give you an accurate count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 in your genome annotation database.
