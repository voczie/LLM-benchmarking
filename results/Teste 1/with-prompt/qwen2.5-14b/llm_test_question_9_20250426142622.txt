To calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all exons associated with the BRCA1 gene.
2. Calculate the length of each exon.
3. Compute the average exon size.

Here's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding Python code using SQLite queries and the `sqlite3` module in Python:

### Step 1: Identify All Exons Associated with BRCA1 Gene

First, we need to find all exons that belong to the BRCA1 gene. We can do this by querying the database for exons that are children of the BRCA1 transcript.

### Step 2: Calculate the Length of Each Exon

Once we have identified the exons, we calculate their lengths using the `start` and `end` coordinates.

### Step 3: Compute the Average Exon Size

Finally, we compute the average length of these exons.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import sqlite3
from collections import defaultdict

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')
db = conn.cursor()

def get_exons_for_gene(gene_id):
    # Find all transcript IDs associated with the gene ID
    transcripts = db.execute(
        "SELECT child FROM relations WHERE parent = ? AND level = 1",
        (gene_id,)
    ).fetchall()
    
    transcript_ids = [t[0] for t in transcripts]
    
    # Find all exons associated with these transcripts
    exons = []
    for transcript_id in transcript_ids:
        exon_query = db.execute(
            "SELECT id, seqid, start, end FROM features WHERE parent = ? AND featuretype = 'exon'",
            (transcript_id,)
        ).fetchall()
        
        exons.extend(exon_query)
    
    return exons

def calculate_average_exon_size(gene_id):
    # Get all exons for the gene
    exons = get_exons_for_gene(gene_id)
    
    exon_lengths = []
    for exon in exons:
        length = exon[3] - exon[2] + 1  # Calculate exon length (end - start + 1)
        exon_lengths.append(length)
    
    if not exon_lengths:
        return None
    
    average_length = sum(exon_lengths) / len(exon_lengths)
    return average_length

# Example: BRCA1 gene ID
brca1_gene_id = 'ENSG00000139607'  # Replace with the actual BRCA1 gene ID from your database

average_exon_size = calculate_average_exon_size(brca1_gene_id)
print(f"The average exon size of BRCA1 transcript isoforms is: {average_exon_size:.2f} bp")
```

### Explanation:

1. **get_exons_for_gene**: This function retrieves all exons associated with a given gene ID by first finding the transcripts and then querying for exons that belong to these transcripts.
   
2. **calculate_average_exon_size**: This function calculates the average length of the exons retrieved from `get_exons_for_gene`.

3. **brca1_gene_id**: Replace this with the actual BRCA1 gene ID in your database.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have the correct gene ID for BRCA1.
- The exon lengths are calculated as `(end - start + 1)` to include both endpoints of the exon.
- If there are no exons found, the function will return `None`.

This script should give you the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms in your genome annotation database.
