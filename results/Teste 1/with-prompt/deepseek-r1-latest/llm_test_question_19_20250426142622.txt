Okay, so I need to help the user generate a boxplot comparing the sizes of protein_coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts using their SQLite database. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that the user's database has a features table with various attributes, including 'start' and 'end'. The length of each transcript would be end minus start plus one (since both ends are inclusive). 

I should create a function that calculates the length for each feature type. So, I'll write a function called get_transcript_lengths that takes a database connection and a list of feature types. It will loop through each feature in the database, check if it's an RNA molecule (like gene, rna, etc.), determine its type based on attributes like 'gene_biotype' or 'transcript_type', calculate the length, and store it in a dictionary with the feature type as the key.

Wait, but for miRNAs and lncRNAs, I need to make sure they're treated correctly. Maybe their types are stored differently, so I'll have to check if 'transcript_type' is present or not. If not, perhaps look at 'gene_biotype' to infer RNA type.

Once the lengths are collected for each category, I can use matplotlib to create a boxplot. The categories will be protein_coding, lncRNA, and miRNA. Each category's data will be the list of lengths for that type.

I should also handle cases where some feature types might not have any entries, so I'll include checks in the plotting function to skip those if necessary.

Putting it all together, the steps are: extract features, calculate their lengths based on type, collect these lengths into a dictionary, and then generate the boxplot using the collected data. I'll make sure to import necessary modules like sqlite3 for database access, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, and pandas or numpy for handling data.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me outline the code step by step.

To help you create a boxplot comparing protein_coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcript sizes, I'll guide you through the process with an example implementation:

1. **Calculate Transcript Lengths**
2. **Prepare Data for Visualization**
3. **Generate Boxplot**

Here's the complete code:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

def get_transcript_lengths(db_connection, feature_types):
    """
    Calculate lengths of transcripts for specified types.
    
    Args:
        db_connection: SQLite connection to the database
        feature_types: List of feature type strings (e.g., ['protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA'])
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with feature types as keys and list of lengths as values.
    """
    length_dict = {ft: [] for ft in feature_types}
    
    cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT id, seqid, start, end FROM features WHERE featuretype IN (?)", 
                  tuple(feature_types))
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    
    for row in rows:
        feature_id, seqid, start, end = row
        length = end - start + 1
        
        # Determine the type of feature
        attributes = db_connection.execute("SELECT attributes FROM features WHERE id = ?", 
                                           (feature_id,)).fetchone()
        
        if 'transcript_type' in attributes:
            ft = ' '.join([x.capitalize() for x in attributes.split(',')])
        elif 'gene_biotype' in attributes:
            ft = ' '.join([x.capitalize() for x in attributes.split(',')])
        else:
            ft = 'unknown'
            
        if ft in length_dict and ft in feature_types:
            index = feature_types.index(ft)
            length_dict[ft][index] = length
            
    return length_dict

def create_boxplot(length_data, feature_types):
    """
    Create a boxplot from transcript length data.
    
    Args:
        length_data: Dictionary with feature types as keys and list of lengths
        feature_types: List of feature type strings to include in the plot
    """
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    
    # Filter out any empty categories
    valid_types = [ft for ft in feature_types if len(length_data[ft]) > 0]
    
    data = []
    labels = []
    for ft in valid_types:
        data.append(length_data[ft])
        labels.append(ft)
    
    plt.boxplot(data, labels=labels)
    plt.title('Boxplot of Transcript Sizes by Type')
    plt.xlabel('Transcript Type')
    plt.ylabel('Length (bp)')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.show()

# Connect to your database
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Example feature types to include
feature_types = ['protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA']

# Get transcript lengths
length_data = get_transcript_lengths(db_connection, feature_types)

# Create boxplot
create_boxplot(length_data, feature_types)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Database Connection**: Connect to your SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.

2. **Get Transcript Lengths**:
   - The function `get_transcript_lengths` queries the database for features of specified types.
   - It calculates the length as `end - start + 1` (since both ends are inclusive).
   - Determines the feature type based on 'attributes' field, which might contain 'transcript_type' or 'gene_biotype'.

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - The data is prepared in a dictionary where keys are feature types and values are lists of lengths.

4. **Generate Boxplot**:
   - Uses matplotlib to create a boxplot.
   - Only includes categories with valid (non-empty) length data.
   - Rotates x-labels for better readability.

### Notes:

- Replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file path.
- Adjust `feature_types` list to include the specific transcript types you want to analyze.
- Ensure your database schema has appropriate fields named 'start', 'end', and 'attributes'.

This implementation will help visualize the distribution of transcript lengths across different RNA types, making it easier to compare their sizes.
