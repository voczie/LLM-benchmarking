Okay, I need to figure out how to determine the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome using the provided database schema and the given code structure tips. 

First, I remember that pseudogenes are genes without a protein-coding sequence but similar in other aspects like structure or location. So, they should be marked as 'pseudogene' in their attributes.

Looking at the database schema, there's an 'features' table where each feature is stored with its details. Each feature has an 'id', 'seqid' which is the chromosome identifier, and various attributes including 'gene_biotype'. For pseudogenes, I should check if 'pseudogene' is in the gene_biotype attribute.

So, my plan is to write a Python function that queries this database. The function will iterate over all features where seqid is 'X', then for each of these, it will check if any of their attributes contain 'pseudogene'. If they do, those are pseudogenes on chromosome X.

I'll use the sqlite3 library to connect to the database and execute the query. I'll need to handle the results appropriately, maybe counting how many such features exist.

Wait, but in the schema, each feature has an 'id' which is unique per feature. So for each feature of type 'gene', if its attributes include 'pseudogene', it's a pseudogene.

I should also consider that some genes might have multiple transcripts or other related features, so I need to make sure I'm only counting the gene entries themselves.

Putting this together, I'll write a function called count_pseudogenes_on_x(), which connects to the database. Then, in a cursor, I'll run a SELECT statement from the 'features' table where seqid is 'X' and 'pseudogene' is in the attributes. The result will be rows of such features, each representing a pseudogene on chromosome X.

I should also handle any potential errors, like if there's no connection or if the query fails, but maybe that's beyond the current scope since the user just wants to know how many.

Finally, I'll execute the query and return the count. So, the function will look something like this: connect to the database, run the query, fetch all results, and count them.

To determine the number of pseudogenes on chromosome X in your genome annotation database, you can use a SQL query that filters for 'pseudogene' entries specifically on chromosome X. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import sqlite3

def count_pseudogenes_on_x():
    # Connect to the database
    with sqlite3.connect('your_database.db') as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # Query to find pseudogenes on chromosome X
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT COUNT(*) 
            FROM features 
            WHERE seqid = 'X' AND 
                   gene_biotype LIKE '%pseudogene%';
        """)
        
        result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
        return result

# Example usage:
pseudogene_count = count_pseudogenes_on_x()
print(f"Number of pseudogenes on chromosome X: {pseudogene_count}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Connect to the Database**: The code connects to your SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
2. **Query Execution**: It executes a SQL query that:
   - Counts all features (genes) where:
     - `seqid` is 'X' (chromosome X).
     - The `gene_biotype` includes 'pseudogene'.
3. **Result Handling**: The result is retrieved and returned as an integer, which represents the number of pseudogenes on chromosome X.

**Note:** 
- Ensure your database file path is correct when connecting.
- Adjust error handling if necessary (e.g., closing the connection properly).
- This query assumes that 'pseudogene' is part of the `gene_biotype` attribute. If the actual column name differs, adjust it in the query.
