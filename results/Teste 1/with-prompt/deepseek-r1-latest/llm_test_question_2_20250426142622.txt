Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine how many lncRNA genes are present on chromosome 7 using the provided database schema and the given code structure tips. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are a type of RNA that don't code for proteins but have various regulatory roles. So, in the context of a genome annotation, I should look for features labeled as 'lncRNA' or something similar.

Looking at the database schema, there's a table called 'features' which includes an 'id', 'seqid', and other attributes. The 'featuretype' field is probably where I can find the type of genomic feature. So, I need to query this table for features where 'featuretype' is 'lncRNA'.

Next, each chromosome has a specific identifier in the 'seqid' column. For human chromosomes, chromosome 1 is typically 'chr1', chromosome 2 is 'chr2', and so on. So, I should filter the results to only include those with 'seqid' equal to 'chr7'.

Once I have all lncRNA genes on chr7, I need to count how many there are. This can be done by checking if each feature's id is unique or if there are multiple entries for the same gene (though in a well-annotated database, each gene should have one entry).

Putting this together, I'll write a Python function that queries the 'features' table. The query will select all rows where 'featuretype' is 'lncRNA' and 'seqid' is 'chr7'. Then, I'll extract the ids of these features and count them to get the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7.

I should also consider if there are any potential issues, like case sensitivity in the database. For example, if the chromosomes are stored as lowercase or have different identifiers, but since it's a standard genome database, I can assume 'chr7' is correctly represented.

Finally, testing the function with the correct schema and ensuring that the query returns the expected results will confirm whether this approach works.

To determine how many lncRNA genes are on chromosome 7 using the provided database schema, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Features**: Look for features of type 'lncRNA' in the `features` table.

2. **Filter by Chromosome**: Extract only those features where `seqid` is 'chr7'.

3. **Count Unique Genes**: Ensure each gene is counted once, even if it has multiple isoforms or entries.

Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
import sqlite3

def count_lncrna_genes_on_chromosome7():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('genome.db')
    
    # Query to find lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = """
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS gene_count 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'lncRNA' AND seqid = 'chr7';
    """
    
    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    
    print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result}")
    
    conn.close()
```

**Explanation**:
- The function connects to the database and executes a query that counts distinct `id`s for 'lncRNA' features on 'chr7'.
- It prints the count, which represents unique lncRNA genes.

This approach efficiently retrieves and counts the required information using SQL within Python.
