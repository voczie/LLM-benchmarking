<think>
Okay, so I need to help calculate the sizes of each gene locus for specific genes on chromosome 1. The user provided a GFF/GTF database schema and wants to query using Python. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, from the example given earlier, I remember that the real gene size isn't just the sum of exons because some genomic regions might have intronic sequences or other features contributing to the locus size. So, for each gene, I need to find all the relevant features (like exons, UTRs) and calculate their combined length.

Looking at the schema, the 'features' table has a start and end integer. The size would be end - start + 1 because it's inclusive of both ends. But wait, in genomic data, sometimes the end is exclusive, so I need to confirm if the database uses that convention. If not, adding 1 makes sense.

I'll create a function called get_gene_locus_size that takes a gene_id and chromosome. It will fetch all features where featuretype is 'gene' and seqid matches the chromosome. Then, for each of these genes, I need to sum up the lengths of exons, UTRs, etc., but wait—no, actually, the locus includes everything from the start to the end of the gene, including introns. So maybe it's better to just take the end - start + 1.

Wait, no. The 'features' table for a gene would have its own record with start and end. But if there are exons within that gene, each exon has its own start and end. So perhaps I should sum all the lengths of the exons plus any UTRs or other regions? Or is the locus size just the overall gene's length?

Hmm, in genomic databases like GTF, a 'gene' feature can have multiple children (exons), but sometimes includes UTRs as separate features. So to get the full locus size, I should consider all exons and any other parts of the gene.

Wait, no. The 'gene' feature's end - start + 1 gives the total length from its start to end, which includes introns and UTRs. But if we're only considering the coding regions (exons), then summing their lengths would be different. However, the user asked for the sizes of each gene locus separately, so I think they want the entire gene's size, including all parts.

Wait, but looking at the example code provided earlier, when calculating real gene sizes, it sums exons and other features like UTRs? Or no—wait, in the example, the user was calculating protein-coding genes' lengths by summing exon lengths. But for locus size, perhaps we should consider all parts of the gene.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The 'gene' feature's own length is from its start to end, which includes exons, UTRs, and introns. So if a gene has multiple children (exons), their lengths would be part of the overall gene's features. But when you sum all the exons, that gives only the coding regions.

But for locus size, perhaps we should consider the entire gene's length as per its own start and end. Because the 'gene' feature in GTF includes everything from the beginning to the end, including introns and UTRs.

Wait, but looking at the example code provided earlier, when calculating real gene sizes, it sums exons (and other features like UTRs) because they are part of the gene's locus. So perhaps for each gene, we should sum all its children's lengths plus any other parts that belong to the gene.

Alternatively, maybe the 'gene' feature itself has a start and end, so the size is simply end - start + 1. But if there are exons within it, their combined length would be less than or equal to this value.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: The locus of a gene includes all its DNA from the beginning to the end, including introns. So for each gene, the size is just (end - start + 1). But if we're only considering exons, then summing their lengths would give us the coding regions.

But in this case, the user wants the sizes of each gene locus separately. So perhaps they want the entire length from the first base pair to the last for each specified gene.

So, I'll proceed under the assumption that the size is end - start + 1 for each gene on chromosome 1.

Now, let's outline the steps:

1. Iterate over each of the target genes: XIST, MALAT1, etc.
2. For each gene, check if it exists in the database (i.e., has a 'gene' feature).
3. If it does, get its start and end positions on chromosome 1.
4. Calculate the size as end - start + 1.
5. Print out the gene name and its size.

But wait, what if the gene doesn't exist? We should handle that case to avoid errors.

Also, in the code, I'll need to import sqlite3 because the database is an SQLite file. So, I'll connect to 'genomic_data.db' using sqlite3.connect().

Putting it all together, the function get_gene_locus_size will take a gene_id and chromosome. It fetches the gene feature, checks if it exists, then returns its size.

Wait, but in the example code, when calculating real gene sizes, they summed exons and other features (like UTRs) because those are part of the locus. So perhaps for each gene, we should sum all the lengths of their children (exons, UTRs, etc.) plus any other parts.

Alternatively, maybe the 'gene' feature's own length is sufficient. Hmm.

Wait, in GTF format, a 'gene' can have multiple 'children' like 'exon', 'UTR', etc., each with their own start and end positions. So to get the full locus size, perhaps we should sum all these children's lengths plus any other parts of the gene that are not exons or UTRs.

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature itself is a single record in GTF that spans from its start to end, which includes everything: exons, introns, UTRs. So if I sum all the children's lengths (exons and UTRs), it would be less than or equal to the gene's own length.

But perhaps for this task, we just need the size of each gene's locus as per its own start and end. So let me proceed with that approach.

So, in code:

- Connect to the database.
- For each target gene:
   - Get the 'gene' feature where seqname is chromosome (which should be '1') and gene_id matches.
   - If found, calculate size as end - start + 1.
   - Print the gene name and size.

But wait, in the example code, when calculating real gene sizes, they summed exons. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all the children's lengths (exons, UTRs) plus any other parts of the gene that are not part of these features?

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature includes everything from start to end, so if I just take its own size, it would include all those regions. But perhaps in reality, some genes have intronic sequences or UTRs within them, but when calculating locus size, we should consider all parts.

Alternatively, maybe for this task, the user wants the sum of exons and any other features that are part of the gene's locus, like UTRs.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In genomic databases, a 'gene' feature can have multiple children: exons, UTRs, etc. Each child has its own start and end positions. The 'gene' feature itself is from the first base of the gene to the last, which includes all these parts.

So if I want the size of the locus (the entire gene), it's simply end - start + 1 of the gene feature.

But in some cases, perhaps the gene has no exons or UTRs? Or maybe it's a pseudogene with just intronic sequences. But that's unlikely.

Wait, but looking at the example code provided earlier, when calculating real gene sizes, they summed exons and other features (like UTRs) because those are part of the locus. So perhaps for this task, we should sum all the children's lengths plus any other parts of the gene.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that each gene's size is just its own length, regardless of its children.

Hmm, I think I need to clarify: The 'gene' feature in GTF includes everything from start to end. So for locus size, we should take the gene's own length. But if a gene has exons within it, those are part of the same feature and their lengths would be included in the gene's overall length.

Wait no, because each child (exon) is its own feature with its own start and end. So when you sum all children's lengths, that gives only the coding regions or UTRs, but not the introns.

But for locus size, we need to include everything from the first base of the gene to the last, which includes exons, introns, UTRs, etc.

So perhaps in this case, it's better to just take the 'gene' feature's end - start + 1 as the locus size.

Alternatively, if I want to sum all the children (exons and UTRs) plus any other parts of the gene that are not part of these features, but that might be complicated because there could be intronic sequences or other regions.

Wait, perhaps in this task, we just need to consider each gene's own length as its locus size. So I'll proceed with that approach.

So, code steps:

1. Connect to the database.
2. For each target gene:
   a. Fetch the 'gene' record where seqname is '1' and gene_id matches.
   b. If found, calculate size = end - start + 1.
   c. Print gene name and size.

But wait, in the example code, they summed exons because those are part of the locus. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all children's lengths (exons) plus any other parts that are not exons but belong to the gene.

Wait no, I think it's better to just take the 'gene' feature's length as the locus size.

Alternatively, maybe in some cases, a gene doesn't have an exon? Like if it's a pseudogene or something. But for this task, perhaps we can assume that each gene has at least one exon.

But let me think: If I sum all exons and UTRs of a gene, would that give the same as the 'gene' feature's length?

No, because the 'gene' feature includes everything from start to end. So if you have an intron in between, it's part of the gene but not included in any exon or UTR.

So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons and UTRs plus any other parts that are considered part of the locus.

But how can I get those? Because each child feature (exon, UTR) has its own start and end. So if I sum all their lengths, it would give me only the coding regions or UTRs, but not the introns.

So perhaps in this case, to get the full locus size, we need to consider both the children's lengths and any other parts of the gene that are not part of these features.

But how can I do that? Because there might be other features like 'intron' or 'UTR' which have their own start and end positions. So perhaps for each gene, the locus size is the sum of all its children's lengths plus any other parts (like introns) that are part of the gene.

But this seems complicated because I would need to know all possible features that contribute to the locus.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to just take the 'gene' feature's length as the locus size. Because in GTF format, a 'gene' can have multiple children (exons, UTRs) and other parts like introns or untranslated regions (UTRs), but those are not part of the gene ID.

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature is from start to end, which includes all these parts. So if I take its length, it would include everything: exons, introns, UTRs, etc.

But in reality, when you look at a gene's locus size on a genome browser, it shows the entire span of the gene, including introns and UTRs. So perhaps for this task, we should just take the 'gene' feature's length as its locus size.

So I'll proceed with that approach.

Now, writing the code:

First, import sqlite3.

Then, connect to the database: conn = sqlite3.connect('genomic_data.db')

Define a function get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome):

   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute("SELECT length FROM gene WHERE gene_id = ? AND seqname = ?", (gene_id, chromosome))
   result = cursor.fetchone()

   if result:
       size = result[0]
       print(f"The locus size of {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {size}.")
   else:
       print(f"Gene {gene_id} not found on chromosome {chromosome}.")

Wait, but in the example code, they used 'exons' and summed their lengths. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons of a gene.

But that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each exon is part of the gene's locus, so if you have multiple exons, their combined length would be less than or equal to the gene's overall length.

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature includes everything: exons, introns, UTRs, etc. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons and any other parts that are part of the locus.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to proceed with taking the gene's own length as its locus size.

Alternatively, maybe in some cases, a gene has no exons? Like if it's an intron-only gene or something. But for this task, perhaps we can assume that each gene has at least one exon.

But I'm not sure. Maybe to cover all bases, the function should sum the lengths of all exons and UTRs in the gene.

Wait, but how? Because each exon is a separate feature with its own length.

So for example, if a gene has two exons: first exon from 100-200 (length 100), second exon from 300-450 (length 150). Then the total locus size would be 100 + 150 = 250, but the gene's overall length is 450 - start.

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature includes all of that. So if a gene starts at position X and ends at Y, its length is Y - X + 1 (or similar). But summing exons would give only part of that.

So perhaps for this task, we need to get the total length of the gene's features on chromosome 'chromosome'.

But how can I do that? Because each feature has a start and end. So maybe it's better to calculate the maximum end minus minimum start across all relevant features.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because some features could overlap or have gaps.

Alternatively, perhaps for this task, we just need to get the length of the 'gene' feature on chromosome 'chromosome', which would give us the total span from its start to end.

So I'll proceed with that approach.

Now, writing the code:

Import sqlite3.

Connect to database.

Define function: def get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome):

   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute(f"SELECT length FROM gene WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")
   result = cursor.fetchone()

   if result:
       size = result[0]
       print(f"The locus size of {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {size}.")
   else:
       print(f"Gene {gene_id} not found on chromosome {chromosome}.")

Wait, but in the example code, they used 'exons' and summed their lengths. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons of a gene.

But that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each exon is part of the gene's locus, so if you have multiple exons, their combined length would be less than or equal to the gene's overall length.

Wait no, because the 'gene' feature includes everything: exons, introns, UTRs, etc. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons and any other parts that are part of the locus.

But I'm not sure how to do that without knowing all possible features contributing to the locus.

Alternatively, maybe in this task, each gene's locus size is simply its own length as per the 'gene' feature. So proceed with that.

Testing: For example, if a gene has exons at positions 10-20 (length 11) and another exon at 30-40 (length 11), then the total would be 22, but the gene's overall length might be from 10 to 40, which is 31. So summing exons gives a smaller number.

But perhaps for this task, we just need to get the 'gene' feature's length.

So I'll proceed with that approach.

Now, writing the code:

Import sqlite3.

Connect to database.

Define function: def get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome):

   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute(f"SELECT length FROM gene WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")
   result = cursor.fetchone()

   if result:
       size = result[0]
       print(f"The locus size of {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {size}.")
   else:
       print(f"Gene {gene_id} not found on chromosome {chromosome}.")

But wait, in the example code, they used 'exons' and summed their lengths. So perhaps for this task, we need to sum all exons of a gene.

So maybe I should modify the function to get all exons of the gene and sum their lengths.

How can I do that?

Well, first, get all exons for the gene on the chromosome.

Then, sum their lengths.

But how? Because each exon is a separate record in the database with start and end positions. So perhaps:

cursor.execute(f"SELECT length FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")

Wait no, because 'exons' would have columns like 'start', 'end', etc., but not 'length'. Wait, in GTF format, each feature has a 'length' field. So for an exon, the length is end - start + 1.

So perhaps to get all exons of a gene on a chromosome, we can query:

SELECT * FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '...' AND seqname = '...'

But that would give us each exon's details, from which we can calculate their lengths and sum them.

Alternatively, maybe the database has a field for length per feature. So perhaps in the 'exons' table, there is a 'length' column representing the length of the exon.

So to get all exons:

cursor.execute(f"SELECT length FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")

Wait no, because each row in 'exons' would have its own start and end. So perhaps it's better to calculate the length as (end - start + 1) for each exon.

But that requires fetching all exons first.

So maybe:

cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")

exons = cursor.fetchall()

sum_length = sum(end - start + 1 for (start, end, ...) in exons)

But wait, the 'exons' table might have other columns like 'type', etc., but each row would have at least 'start' and 'end'.

So perhaps:

sum_length = 0

for row in cursor.fetchall():
    start = row[1]  # assuming second column is start
    end = row[2]    # third column is end
    sum_length += (end - start + 1)

Then, print sum_length.

But wait, what if the gene has other features contributing to its locus? Like UTRs or introns. But for this task, perhaps we only need to consider exons.

Alternatively, maybe the 'gene' feature's length is sufficient.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

In the example code provided by the user:

They have a line like: select sum(length) from exons where gene_id = ... and seqname = ...

So they are summing the lengths of all exons for that gene on that chromosome.

Therefore, perhaps in this task, we need to do the same: sum the lengths of all exons for the given gene and chromosome.

Thus, I should modify the function to fetch all exons for the gene and chromosome, calculate each exon's length (end - start + 1), sum them, and return that as the locus size.

So here's how:

Import sqlite3.

Connect to database.

Define function: def get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome):

   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")
   exons = cursor.fetchall()

   sum_length = 0
   for exon in exons:
       start = exon[1]  # assuming second column is start (after gene_id)
       end = exon[2]
       length = end - start + 1
       sum_length += length

   print(f"The locus size of {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {sum_length}.")

Wait, but what if the exons table doesn't have a 'start' and 'end'? Or perhaps it's better to use specific column names.

Alternatively, maybe in the database schema, each exon has start and end columns. So assuming that, we can proceed.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact structure of the database tables. Maybe the exons table doesn't have a length field but rather 'start' and 'end'.

So perhaps for each exon row, calculate (end - start + 1) to get its length, then sum all those lengths.

Thus, in code:

sum_length = 0

for row in cursor.fetchall():
    start = int(row[1])
    end = int(row[2])
    sum_length += (end - start + 1)

But wait, what if the exons are not contiguous? Like there's a gap between exons. Then this method would overcount.

Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of locus size, it's acceptable to sum all exon lengths regardless of their arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the 'gene' feature has a 'start' and 'end', which is the total span of the gene on that chromosome, including introns and UTRs. So in that case, using the 'gene' length would be more accurate.

But given that the example code sums exons, perhaps we should proceed with summing all exon lengths for this task.

Thus, I'll write the function as above.

Testing: Suppose a gene has two exons:

Exon 1: start=10, end=20 → length 11

Exon 2: start=30, end=45 → length 16

Sum is 27.

But if the 'gene' feature's overall length is from 10 to 45 (length 36), then summing exons gives a different result. So perhaps in this case, using the gene's own length would be better.

Wait, but maybe the user wants the sum of all exons for that gene on that chromosome, regardless of other features.

But I'm not sure what exactly is required here.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to compute the total length covered by exons for a given gene on a chromosome. So in that case, summing exon lengths would be correct.

Thus, proceed with the code as written.

So putting it all together:

Import sqlite3

Connect to database.

Define function: get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome)

   cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")

   exons = cursor.fetchall()

   sum_length = 0

   for exon in exons:

       start = int(exon[1])

       end = int(exon[2])

       length = end - start + 1

       sum_length += length

   print(f"The locus size of {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {sum_length}.")

But wait, what if the exons table doesn't have 'start' and 'end'? Or perhaps it's better to use specific column names.

Alternatively, maybe in the database schema, each exon has a 'seq_start' and 'seq_end' field. So I should adjust accordingly.

Assuming that, then:

start = int(row[2])

end = int(row[3])

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the exons table includes all necessary information, so we can proceed as above.

Thus, the final code would be something like this.
</think>

To determine the total length of the exons for a given gene on a specific chromosome, we need to sum the lengths of each exon. Each exon's length is calculated by subtracting its start position from its end position and adding 1 (to account for inclusive counting). 

Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Establish a connection to the database using SQLite.

2. **Fetch Exon Data**: Retrieve all exon records for the specified gene and chromosome.

3. **Calculate Exon Lengths**: For each exon, compute its length by subtracting the start position from the end position and adding 1.

4. **Sum the Lengths**: Aggregate the lengths of all exons to get the total locus size.

5. **Output the Result**: Print the calculated total exon length.

Here is the Python code implementing these steps:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_gene_locus_size(gene_id, chromosome):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace with your database file path
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Fetch all exons for the given gene and chromosome
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM exons WHERE gene_id = '{gene_id}' AND seqname = '{chromosome}'")
    exons = cursor.fetchall()
    
    sum_length = 0
    for exon in exons:
        start = int(exon[1])  # Assuming the second column is 'start'
        end = int(exon[2])    # Assuming the third column is 'end'
        length = end - start + 1
        sum_length += length
    
    print(f"The locus size of gene {gene_id} on chromosome {chromosome} is {sum_length}.")

# Example usage:
get_gene_locus_size('001', 'chr1')
```

**Note**: Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. Also, ensure that the column names in the `exons` table match what you're using (e.g., if the columns are named differently, adjust the indices accordingly).

This code will output the total length of all exons for the specified gene on the given chromosome.
