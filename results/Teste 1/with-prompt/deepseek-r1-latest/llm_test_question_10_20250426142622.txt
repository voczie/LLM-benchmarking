Okay, so I need to figure out how to find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using the provided database schema and Python code. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The user has a SQLite database with tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. The main table is 'features', which contains all genomic features like genes, exons, etc. Each feature has an id, seqid (which is the chromosome), source (maybe not relevant here), featuretype, start and end positions.

The task is to find where BRCA1 is located on the genome. So I need to look up the gene with the name 'BRCA1' in the features table. Once found, extract its chromosome by looking at the seqid field.

First, I'll write a Python function that queries the database for all genes (where featuretype is 'gene') and checks if any of them have the attribute 'name' equal to 'BRCA1'. 

Wait, but in SQLite, how are attributes stored? They're probably stored as text. So using 'name' in the attributes makes sense.

Once I get BRCA1's record, I can get its start and end positions. The chromosomal position would be either the chromosome number (seqid) where it starts or ends. Typically, genes span multiple chromosomes if they are on different locations, but BRCA1 is a single gene so it should be in one chromosome.

So after fetching BRCA1's data, I can extract its seqid and maybe also check both start and end positions to see which part of the chromosome it occupies. But for chromosomal position, the starting point is usually sufficient unless we need the exact location within the chromosome.

Putting this together, the function will loop through all features, filter those that are genes with name BRCA1, then return their seqid (chromosome) and perhaps start or end positions.

I should also handle cases where the gene isn't found. Maybe raise an error if no BRCA1 is present to avoid silent failures.

So the steps are:

1. Query the 'features' table for all records where featuretype is 'gene' and name is 'BRCA1'.
2. If none found, raise an error.
3. For each matching record, get seqid (chromosome), start, end.
4. Return the chromosome number along with BRCA1's position within it.

I think that covers everything needed to answer the user's question about the chromosomal position of BRCA1.

To determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using the provided database schema and Python code, follow these steps:

### Approach
The task involves querying a SQLite database stored in GFF/GTF format. The key steps are:
1. **Identify the Gene**: Locate the record for the BRCA1 gene within the database.
2. **Extract Chromosomal Information**: Once identified, extract the chromosome (seqid) and genomic position details (start and end positions).

### Solution Code
```python
import sqlite3

def find_chromosomal_position(db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Query to find BRCA1 gene
    brca1_query = """
        SELECT * 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND name = 'BRCA1'
    """
    
    cursor.execute(brca1_query)

    brca1_records = cursor.fetchall()
    
    if not brca1_records:
        raise ValueError("BRCA1 gene not found in the database.")
        
    for record in brca1_records:
        seqid, source, featuretype, start, end, score, strand, frame, attributes = record
        print(f"BRCA1 is located on chromosome {seqid}, from position {start} to {end}.")
    
    conn.close()

# Replace 'your_database_path.db' with the actual path to your database file
find_chromosomal_position('your_database_path.db')
```

### Explanation
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **Query Execution**: A SQL query is executed to find all records of BRCA1 genes. This query selects from the 'features' table where `featuretype` is 'gene' and `name` is 'BRCA1'.
- **Result Handling**: If no BRCA1 gene is found, a ValueError is raised. Otherwise, for each matching record, the chromosome (seqid), start position, and end position are printed.

This approach efficiently retrieves and displays the chromosomal location of the BRCA1 gene using straightforward SQL queries and Python data handling.
