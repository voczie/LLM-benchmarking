Okay, I need to figure out how to calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the provided database schema. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user wants the average exon size of BRCA1 transcripts. So, I'll need to find all exons that belong to the BRCA1 transcript and calculate their lengths.

Looking at the database structure, there are tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. The main table is 'features' which contains all the genomic features, including exons. Each exon will have a start and end position.

I remember that in GFF files, each feature has an id, and for transcipts, there are multiple exons linked through relations. So, I'll need to find all exons associated with BRCA1 transcript isoforms.

Wait, how do I get the correct transcripts? The 'features' table might have both genes and transcripts. But since BRCA1 is a gene, maybe its isoforms are stored as separate transcripts or within the same feature type?

Hmm, perhaps each isoform of BRCA1 will be represented as a separate transcript in the database. So I need to find all transcripts with the 'gene_id' set to BRCA1 and then get their exons.

Wait no, that's not right. The 'features' table includes genes, which have an id (gene_id), but transcripts are also features of type 'transcript'. So for BRCA1, I need to find all transcripts with the same gene_id as BRCA1? Or maybe each isoform is a separate transcript.

Wait, perhaps in this database schema, each isoform is represented as a separate transcript. So first, I'll query the 'features' table where featuretype is 'transcript' and id starts with 'BRCA1' or has gene_id 'BRCA1'? Or maybe it's stored under the same parent.

Alternatively, perhaps the relations table links transcripts to their parent genes. So each transcript will have a parent which is its corresponding gene. So I can find all transcripts whose parent is BRCA1 and then get their exons.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, I'll query the 'features' table for features where featuretype is 'transcript', id starts with BRCA1 (or maybe it's stored as a separate transcript), but perhaps using relations to find the correct transcripts linked to BRCA1.

Wait, no. The relations table has parent and child entries. So each relation represents that one feature is part of another. For example, a gene might have multiple exons, so each exon would be a child of the gene.

But for a transcript, it's more complex because a transcript can span multiple genes or regions? Or perhaps in this case, BRCA1 is a single gene whose isoforms are different transcripts.

So to get all exons that belong to BRCA1 transcript isoforms, I need to find all transcripts where the parent is BRCA1 (if any) and then collect their exons.

Wait, but how do I know which transcripts correspond to BRCA1? Maybe each isoform of BRCA1 has a different id. For example, BRCA1-isoform1, BRCA1-isoform2, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'transcript' feature's id is unique per isoform. So if BRCA1 has multiple isoforms, their ids would be something like BRCA1.1, BRCA1.2, etc.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to query all transcripts and then filter those whose parent is a gene with the same id as BRCA1.

Wait, perhaps each transcript has an id that includes 'BRCA1', but more accurately, their parent would be a gene with gene_id 'BRCA1'.

So here's a plan:

1. Find all transcripts where their parent is a feature with featuretype 'gene' and whose id is 'BRCA1'. This will give me all isoforms of BRCA1.

2. For each such transcript, collect all its exons.

3. Calculate the length of each exon as end - start + 1 (since it's inclusive).

4. Compute the average of these lengths across all exons in all BRCA1 isoforms.

So let's structure this step by step.

First, query the 'features' table to find all transcripts where their parent is a gene with id 'BRCA1'. Wait, no: the relations table has entries for parents and children. So each relation is (parent, child, level). So if I want to find all children of BRCA1, which are its isoforms.

Wait, but how do I get all transcripts that have BRCA1 as their parent? Because a gene can have multiple transcripts, each with different ids.

So perhaps the approach is:

- Find all relations where parent is 'BRCA1' and featuretype is 'gene'. Then, for each such relation, find the child which is a transcript. But wait, no: because BRCA1 as a gene would be linked to its isoforms via relations where the parent is BRCA1 (as a gene) and the child is the transcript.

Wait, but in the database schema, 'features' table has an id column, so each feature has an id. So for example, if BRCA1 is a gene with id 'BRCA1', then any relation where parent is 'BRCA1' would have children which are its transcripts.

So first, I can find all relations where the parent is 'BRCA1' and the child's featuretype is 'transcript'. Then, for each such child (transcript), collect their exons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to directly query the 'features' table for features of type 'transcript' whose id starts with BRCA1 or has gene_id BRCA1. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, maybe using relations is more precise because each transcript will have a parent which is its corresponding gene (BRCA1). So perhaps the correct approach is:

- Find all transcripts where their parent in the relations table is a feature with id 'BRCA1' and featuretype 'gene'.

Once I have those transcripts, then for each of them, get all exons.

So step by step:

1. Use the relations table to find all children (transcripts) whose parents are features with id 'BRCA1' and featuretype 'gene'. So query the relations where parent is in (select id from features where id = 'BRCA1' and featuretype = 'gene').

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, I can write a subquery to get all parents of BRCA1 genes and then find their children.

But perhaps it's easier to directly query the relations table for any relation where parent is 'BRCA1' (as a gene) and child is a transcript.

Wait, but in the database schema, each feature has an id. So if BRCA1 is a gene with id 'BRCA1', then any relation where parent is 'BRCA1' would have children which are its transcripts.

So perhaps:

SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene') 

But wait, the feature's id might not be exactly 'BRCA1', but maybe it's stored as a separate table. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each transcript that is part of BRCA1 will have its parent in the relations table where the parent is a gene with id 'BRCA1'.

So first, find all transcripts whose parents are genes with id 'BRCA1' and featuretype 'gene'. Then collect their exons.

Once I have those transcripts, for each, get all exons. For each exon, calculate length as end - start + 1. Sum all these lengths and count the number of exons to compute the average.

Putting this into code:

First, find all such transcripts:

SELECT t.id AS transcript_id FROM features t WHERE 
    featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
    (SELECT id FROM features g WHERE g.id = 'BRCA1' AND g.featuretype = 'gene') 
    child_of t.parent_id

Wait, but in the relations table, each relation has parent_id and child_id. So perhaps:

SELECT r.child_id AS transcript_id FROM relations r WHERE 
    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')

But wait, this would give me all transcripts whose parents are BRCA1 gene.

Once I have the transcript IDs, then for each, get their exons:

SELECT e.* FROM features e WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND e.parent_id = (SELECT child_id FROM relations r WHERE r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene'))

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe it's better to first get all the exons whose parents are BRCA1 transcripts.

Alternatively, perhaps a more efficient way is:

- Find all relations where parent is a gene with id 'BRCA1'.

Then for each such relation, find the child (transcript) and then collect its exons.

So in code:

SELECT e.start, e.end FROM features e WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (
        SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
            r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
    )

Wait, but this might not work because the parent in the relation is a gene, and the child is a transcript. So for each such relation, we can get the child's exons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first find all transcripts that are part of BRCA1:

SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
    featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM relations r WHERE 
            r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene') 
            AND r.child_id = t.id
    )

Once I have those transcript IDs, then for each, get their exons.

But perhaps it's better to directly query the exons whose parents are BRCA1 transcripts.

So:

SELECT e.start, e.end FROM features e WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (
        SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
            featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
            t.parent_id IN (
                SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
            )
    )

This seems quite nested, but it should work.

Once I have all exons for BRCA1 transcripts, then sum their lengths and count the number of exons to compute the average.

So in code:

SELECT 
    SUM(e.end - e.start + 1) AS total_length,
    COUNT(*) AS num_exons
FROM features e
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (
        SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
            featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
            t.parent_id IN (
                SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
            )
    )

Then, the average would be total_length / num_exons.

But wait, what if there are no exons for BRCA1? Then COUNT(*) would be zero, leading to division by zero. So perhaps we need to handle that case.

Alternatively, in the code, after getting all exons, sum their lengths and count them.

Putting it all together:

First, get all exons whose parents are BRCA1 transcripts.

Then compute the average length of those exons.

So the SQL query would be something like:

SELECT 
    SUM(e.end - e.start + 1) / COUNT(*) AS avg_length
FROM features e
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (
        SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
            featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
            t.parent_id IN (
                SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
            )
    )

This should give the average length of all exons that are part of BRCA1 transcripts.

But wait, perhaps there's a more efficient way. Maybe using window functions or subqueries differently.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to first get all the exons for BRCA1 transcripts and then compute their lengths.

So:

SELECT e.start, e.end FROM features e WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (
        SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
            featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
            t.parent_id IN (
                SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
            )
    )

Then, for each of these exons, compute the length and sum them up.

But perhaps it's better to do this in a single query using subqueries.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to break down the steps:

WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
        r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
        featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
        t.parent_id IN cte1
)
SELECT e.start, e.end FROM features e WHERE 
    featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (SELECT t.id FROM cte2)

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is sufficient.

In any case, once I have all exons for BRCA1 transcripts, sum their lengths and count them to get the average.

So in code:

SELECT 
    SUM(end - start + 1) AS total,
    COUNT(*) AS num_exons
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    parent_id IN (
        SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
            featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
            t.parent_id IN (
                SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                    r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
            )
    );

Then, the average is total / num_exons.

But in SQL, division by zero can be an issue. So perhaps we need to handle that case separately or use NULLIF.

So:

SELECT 
    COALESCE(total, 0) / COALESCE(num_exons, 1) AS avg_length
FROM (
    SELECT 
        SUM(end - start + 1) AS total,
        COUNT(*) AS num_exons
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
        parent_id IN (
            SELECT t.id FROM features t WHERE 
                featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
                t.parent_id IN (
                    SELECT r.child_id FROM relations r WHERE 
                        r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
                )
            )
    )
)

This should handle cases where there are no exons for BRCA1.

Alternatively, perhaps the query can be written as:

WITH brca1_transcripts AS (
    SELECT t.id 
    FROM features t 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
        t.parent_id IN (
            SELECT r.child_id 
            FROM relations r 
            WHERE r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
        )
)
SELECT 
    SUM(e.end - e.start + 1) / COUNT(*) AS avg_length
FROM features e 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (brca1_transcripts)

This uses a CTE to first get all the transcript IDs for BRCA1, then in the main query gets exons whose parent is one of those transcripts.

I think this approach is clearer and more manageable.

So putting it all together:

First, create a CTE that selects all transcript IDs (e.id) where their parent is a relation child_id pointing to a gene with id 'BRCA1'.

Then, in the main query, select exons whose parent_id is in that CTE.

Compute the sum of end - start + 1 and divide by count(*) to get average length.

So the final SQL would be:

WITH brca1_transcripts AS (
    SELECT t.id 
    FROM features t 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
        t.parent_id IN (
            SELECT r.child_id 
            FROM relations r 
            WHERE r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
        )
)
SELECT 
    SUM(e.end - e.start + 1) / COUNT(*) AS avg_length
FROM features e 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (brca1_transcripts)

This should give the average length of all exons that are part of BRCA1 transcripts.

I think this approach is solid. It first narrows down to the relevant transcripts and then gets their exons, computes the sum and count, and divides for the average.
</think>

To determine the average length of all exons that belong to the BRCA1 gene, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Transcripts**: First, find all transcript IDs associated with the BRCA1 gene by checking their parent relationships in the relations table.

2. **Retrieve Exons for These Transcripts**: Next, obtain the exons whose parent IDs correspond to the identified BRCA1 transcripts.

3. **Calculate Average Length**: Finally, compute the average length of these exons by summing their lengths and dividing by the count of such exons.

Here is the SQL query that implements this approach:

```sql
WITH brca1_transcripts AS (
    SELECT t.id 
    FROM features t 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND 
        t.parent_id IN (
            SELECT r.child_id 
            FROM relations r 
            WHERE r.parent_id = (SELECT id FROM features f WHERE f.id = 'BRCA1' AND f.featuretype = 'gene')
        )
)
SELECT 
    SUM(e.end - e.start + 1) / COUNT(*) AS avg_length
FROM features e 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND 
    e.parent_id IN (brca1_transcripts)
```

This query efficiently narrows down the exons of interest and calculates their average length.
