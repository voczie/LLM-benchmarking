Okay, I need to help the user generate a scatterplot showing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using their SQLite database. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the database schema includes a 'features' table where each feature type (like genes) is stored with start and end positions. For gene sizes, I need both the start and end points because size isn't directly given but can be calculated as end - start + 1.

I should write a Python script using sqlite3 to connect to their database. Then, I'll query all features of type 'gene' that are located on chromosome 'X'. 

Wait, how do I get the chromosome number? The 'seqid' field contains the chromosome identifier, so for X, it's likely stored as 'X'.

Once I have all the genes on X, I calculate each gene's size by subtracting start from end and adding 1. Then, I'll collect these sizes into a list.

Next, I need to visualize this data. The user wants a scatterplot, so I'll use matplotlib. But since it's a single value per gene, maybe a histogram would be more informative than a scatterplot. Alternatively, if they specifically want a scatterplot, each gene can be plotted as a single point on the y-axis with all points at x=0 or spread along x-axis.

I'll create a figure and axis, plot the sizes using plt.hist(), set labels and title, then display the plot.

Wait, maybe I should use a boxplot to show the distribution. That might be clearer. So instead of a scatterplot, perhaps a boxplot would better represent the distribution of gene sizes.

Alternatively, if they really want a scatterplot, each gene can have a unique x-coordinate and y-value as its size. But with many genes, it might look messy. A histogram or boxplot is probably better for showing distribution.

I'll proceed by creating a list of gene sizes, then plotting them in a boxplot to show the distribution clearly.

To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on chromosome X, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('genome_annotation.db')

# Query all genes on chromosome X
genes_x = conn.execute("SELECT start, end FROM features WHERE featuretype='gene' AND seqid='X';")

# Calculate gene sizes and collect data
sizes = []
for row in genes_x:
    size = row[1] - row[0] + 1
    sizes.append(size)

# Create a simple scatterplot (or histogram) of gene sizes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(sizes, bins=50, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
plt.xlabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Genes')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code:
1. Connects to your SQLite database
2. Queries all genes located on chromosome 'X'
3. Calculates the size of each gene as `end - start + 1`
4. Creates a histogram showing the distribution of these sizes

If you specifically want a scatterplot instead of a histogram, you could modify the code to plot individual points:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(range(len(sizes)), sizes, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
plt.xlabel('Gene Index')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This scatterplot will show each gene's size as a point along the y-axis, with all points aligned along the x-axis since we're only measuring one dimension (size).
