Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine how many miRNA genes exist on chromosome 10 using the provided database schema and the given code structure tips. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, I know that miRNAs are typically non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation. So, I'm looking for features in the database labeled as 'miRNA'. But wait, does the database have a specific attribute for miRNA genes? The schema doesn't explicitly mention it, but perhaps there's an indirect way.

Looking at the example code provided earlier, when calculating real gene sizes, they check if 'gene_biotype' includes 'protein_coding'. Similarly, maybe I can use a similar approach here. So, I'll look for features where 'miRNA' is part of their gene_biotype or another relevant attribute.

Next, I need to ensure that these miRNA genes are located on chromosome 10. That means the 'seqid' should be 'chr10'. 

So, my plan is:
1. Iterate through all 'gene' features in the database.
2. For each gene, check if its 'gene_biotype' includes 'miRNA'.
3. Ensure that the gene's 'seqid' is 'chr10'.
4. Count how many such genes exist.

I should also consider whether there are other possible attributes or sources for miRNA information. But given the schema, using 'gene_biotype' seems the most straightforward approach.

Now, translating this into code: I'll write a function that queries the database, filters the genes based on the conditions mentioned, and returns the count. 

I need to make sure that the query is efficient, so using generators or list comprehensions would be better. Also, handling cases where no miRNA genes are found on chromosome 10 should return zero.

Testing this function with the given database schema will help verify if it works correctly. If there are any issues, like missing 'miRNA' entries or incorrect seqid formats, I'll need to adjust the query accordingly.

To determine how many miRNA genes exist in chromosome 10 using the provided database schema and code structure tips, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Understand the Query Requirements**: We are looking for features labeled as 'miRNA' on chromosome 10.

2. **Identify Relevant Attributes**:
   - `seqid`: Specifies the chromosome (e.g., 'chr10').
   - `gene_biotype`: Indicates gene type, which may include 'miRNA'.

3. **Query Strategy**: 
   - Filter features of type 'gene'.
   - Check if their `gene_biotype` includes 'miRNA'.
   - Ensure `seqid` is 'chr10'.

4. **Efficient Querying**: Use a generator expression to iterate through relevant genes and apply filters.

### Solution Code:
```python
def count_mirna_genes_on_chromosome_10():
    import sqlite3

    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('genome.db')

    # Query to find miRNA genes on chromosome 10
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
          AND gene_biotype LIKE '%miRNA%'
          AND seqid = 'chr10';
    """)

    # Get the result
    mirna_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

    print(f"Number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10: {mirna_count}")

    conn.close()
```

### Explanation:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the database using `sqlite3.connect`.
- **Query Execution**: A SQL query is executed to count 'miRNA' genes on 'chr10'.
  - `WHERE` clause filters by feature type ('gene'), includes 'miRNA' in gene_biotype, and specifies seqid as 'chr10'.
- **Result Handling**: The result is retrieved and printed.

This approach efficiently counts the miRNA genes on chromosome 10 using direct querying and filtering based on the provided schema.
