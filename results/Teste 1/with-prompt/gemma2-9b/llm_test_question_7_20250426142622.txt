```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to find the number of exons for the XIST gene
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'exon'
  AND parent IN (SELECT id FROM features WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND name = 'XIST');
"""

cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

print(f"The XIST gene has {result[0]} exons.")

conn.close()
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to the database:** Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
2. **Execute the query:** The SQL query does the following:
   - Selects the count of all rows (`COUNT(*)`).
   - Filters for features on chromosome 'X'.
   - Further filters for features of type 'exon'.
   - Ensures that these exons are children (direct descendants) of a gene with the name 'XIST' on chromosome 'X'.

3. **Fetch and print the result:** The `fetchone()` method retrieves the single result (a tuple containing the exon count). We then print this count in a user-friendly format.
4. **Close the connection:** It's good practice to close the database connection when you're finished with it.
