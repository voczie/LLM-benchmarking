```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your actual database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query to find the chromosomal position of BRCA1
query = """
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
"""

cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Print the chromosomal position
if result:
    chromosome, start, end = result
    print(f"The BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome {chromosome} from position {start} to {end}.")
else:
    print("BRCA1 gene not found in the database.")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   - Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
   - The code establishes a connection to the database and creates a cursor object to execute SQL queries.

2. **Construct the Query:**
   - The query selects the `seqid` (chromosome), `start`, and `end` positions from the `features` table.
   - It filters for features of type `'gene'` and those whose `attributes` contain the string `'BRCA1%'`. This assumes that BRCA1 gene information is stored within the `attributes` field.

3. **Execute the Query:**
   - The `cursor.execute(query)` line runs the SQL query against the database.

4. **Fetch the Result:**
   - `cursor.fetchone()` retrieves a single row (the first match) from the query result. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

5. **Process and Print the Result:**
   - The code checks if a result was returned.
     - If so, it unpacks the chromosome, start position, and end position from the result tuple and prints them in a formatted string.
     - If no result is found, it prints a message indicating that the BRCA1 gene wasn't found in the database.

6. **Close the Connection:**
   - `conn.close()` closes the database connection to release resources.
