```python
import sqlite3

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Find the IDs of HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes
hoxc11_id = None  
hoxc12_id = None 
cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%'")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    hoxc11_id = row[0]

cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%'")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    hoxc12_id = row[0]

# Query for genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both strands
cursor.execute("""
SELECT f.id, f.featuretype 
FROM features AS f
JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent IN (?, ?)  -- Parent IDs of HOXC11 and HOXC12
AND f.strand IN ('+', '-') -- Filter by strand (+ or -)
ORDER BY f.start;
""", (hoxc11_id, hoxc12_id))

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(f"Gene ID: {row[0]}, Gene Type: {row[1]}")

conn.close()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to your SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`. Replace 'your_database.db' with the actual filename.

2. **Finding HOXC11 and HOXC12 IDs:** Use SQL queries to retrieve the IDs of the `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` genes from the `features` table based on their attributes (e.g., using `LIKE '%HOXC11%'`).

3. **Querying for Intervening Genes:**
   - Construct a SQL query that joins the `features` and `relations` tables. 
   - Use `JOIN relations AS r ON f.id = r.child` to link child genes (the ones we're interested in) with their parent genes (HOXC11 or HOXC12).
   - Filter by `r.parent IN (?, ?)` to include only relationships where the parent is either HOXC11 or HOXC12.
   - Include `AND f.strand IN ('+', '-')` to consider both strands (+ and -).

4. **Retrieving Results:** Execute the query using `cursor.execute()` and fetch the results with `cursor.fetchall()`.

5. **Printing Output:** Iterate through the fetched results and print the gene IDs and types.
