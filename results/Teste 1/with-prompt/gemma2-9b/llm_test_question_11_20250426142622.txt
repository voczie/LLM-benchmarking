```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your actual database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

genes = ['NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB']

chromosome_locations = {}

for gene in genes:
    query = f"SELECT seqid FROM features WHERE featuretype='gene' AND attributes LIKE '%{gene}%'" 
    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    if result:
        chromosome_locations[gene] = result[0]

for gene, chromosome in chromosome_locations.items():
    print(f"{gene} is located on chromosome {chromosome}")

conn.close()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Connect to the Database:**
   - Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual filename of your SQLite database.
   - The code establishes a connection to the database using `sqlite3.connect()`.

2. **Define Gene List:**
   - Create a list `genes` containing the names of the genes you want to find (NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, RELB).

3. **Create Dictionary for Results:**
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `chromosome_locations` to store the chromosome information for each gene.

4. **Iterate Through Genes:**
   - The code loops through each gene in the `genes` list.

5. **Construct SQL Query:**
   - For each gene, it builds a query that selects the `seqid` (chromosome) from the `features` table. 
   - The query uses `LIKE` to search for the gene name within the `attributes` column of the features table. This assumes your annotation data includes gene names as attributes.

6. **Execute Query and Fetch Result:**
   - The `cursor.execute(query)` line runs the SQL query.
   - `cursor.fetchone()` retrieves the first (and hopefully only) result from the query, which is a tuple containing the chromosome ID.

7. **Store Chromosome Information:**
   - If a result is found, the gene name and its corresponding chromosome are stored in the `chromosome_locations` dictionary.

8. **Print Results:**
   - After processing all genes, the code iterates through the `chromosome_locations` dictionary and prints the chromosome location for each gene.
