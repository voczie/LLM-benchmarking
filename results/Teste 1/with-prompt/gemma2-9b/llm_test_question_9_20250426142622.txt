**Explanation:**

1. **Connect to the database:** Replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file name.
2. **Query for BRCA1 transcripts:** The SQL query selects transcript features (featuretype = 'transcript') on chromosome 17 and filters by the gene name "BRCA1" in the attributes. You might need to adjust the attribute key based on your database schema.
3. **Iterate through transcripts:** The code loops through each BRCA1 transcript found.
4. **Extract exon information:** For each transcript, it queries for its child features (exons) using the `relations` table and calculates the size of each exon.
5. **Calculate average exon size:** It sums up all exon sizes and divides by the number of exons to get the average size for that transcript.

**Important Notes:**

- This code assumes your database schema and attribute naming conventions are as described in the provided schema. Adjust accordingly if they differ.
- The `attributes` field is assumed to be stored as JSON. If it's in a different format, you'll need to parse it appropriately.
