```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to count pseudogenes on chromosome X
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM features
    WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND 'pseudogene' IN (attributes)
""")

result = cursor.fetchone()[0]  

print(f"There are {result} pseudogenes on chromosome X.")

conn.close()
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to the database:**
   - Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
   - `sqlite3.connect()` establishes a connection to the database.

2. **Create a cursor object:**
   - The `cursor` object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results.

3. **Execute the query:**
   - The SQL query selects the count of features that meet these criteria:
     - `seqid = 'X'`:  The feature is located on chromosome X.
     - `featuretype = 'gene'`: The feature is a gene.
     - `'pseudogene' IN (attributes)`: The attribute "pseudogene" is present in the `attributes` field of the feature.

4. **Fetch the result:**
   - `cursor.fetchone()` retrieves the first row of the result set as a tuple. We take the first element of this tuple (`[0]`) which contains the count.

5. **Print the result:**
   - The `print` statement displays the number of pseudogenes found on chromosome X.

6. **Close the connection:**
   - `conn.close()` releases the database connection.
