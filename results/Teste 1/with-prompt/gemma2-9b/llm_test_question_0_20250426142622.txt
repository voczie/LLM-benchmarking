```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')  # Replace 'your_database.db' with your database file
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Count genes on chromosome 3
gene_count = cursor.execute(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE seqid='3' AND featuretype='gene'"
).fetchone()[0]

# Count transcripts on chromosome 3
transcript_count = cursor.execute(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE seqid='3' AND featuretype='transcript'"
).fetchone()[0]

print(f"Number of genes on chromosome 3: {gene_count}")
print(f"Number of transcripts on chromosome 3: {transcript_count}")

conn.close()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Connect to the database:** Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
2. **Execute queries:**
   - The first query selects all features from the `features` table where `seqid` is '3' (chromosome 3) and `featuretype` is 'gene'. It then counts the results using `COUNT(*)`.
   - The second query does the same but for transcripts (`featuretype='transcript'`).
3. **Fetch and print results:**
   - `.fetchone()` retrieves a single row (the result of the count) from the cursor.
   - `[0]` accesses the first element (the count value) within that row.
   - The results are printed using f-strings for clear output.

**Remember:** This assumes your database schema is exactly as provided in the prompt. If it differs, you'll need to adjust the queries accordingly.
