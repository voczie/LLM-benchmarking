Let's break down how to generate a stacked bar plot representing the proportions of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA genes on each chromosome using your SQLite database schema.

**1. Data Extraction:**

* **Identify Feature Types:** You need to filter your `features` table based on feature types:
    *  `protein_coding`: Select features where `featuretype` is "gene" or a similar term indicating protein-coding genes.
    *  `lncRNA`: Select features where `featuretype` is "lncRNA" or a similar term.
    *  `miRNA`: Select features where `featuretype` is "miRNA" or a similar term.

* **Group by Chromosome:** For each feature type, group the results by `seqid` (chromosome). This will give you counts of each gene type on each chromosome.

**2. SQL Query:**

```sql
-- Calculate counts for each feature type per chromosome
WITH FeatureCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        seqid,  -- Chromosome ID
        CASE WHEN featuretype = 'protein_coding' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS protein_coding_count,
        CASE WHEN featuretype = 'lncRNA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS lncRNA_count,
        CASE WHEN featuretype = 'miRNA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS miRNA_count
    FROM features
    GROUP BY seqid
)

-- Select the data for plotting
SELECT 
    seqid,  -- Chromosome ID
    SUM(protein_coding_count) AS total_protein_coding,
    SUM(lncRNA_count) AS total_lncRNA,
    SUM(miRNA_count) AS total_miRNA
FROM FeatureCounts
GROUP BY seqid;

```

**3. Data Visualization:**

* **Choose a Tool:** Use a plotting library like Matplotlib (Python), ggplot2 (R), or similar to create the stacked bar plot.

* **Input Data:** Pass the results of your SQL query as input to your visualization tool. Each row in the result set will represent a chromosome, and the columns (`total_protein_coding`, `total_lncRNA`, `total_miRNA`) will define the heights of the bars for each gene type.

* **Customization:**  Customize the plot with labels, titles, colors, and legends to make it clear and informative.
