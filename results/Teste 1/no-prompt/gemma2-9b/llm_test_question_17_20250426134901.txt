Here's how you can generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using your SQLite3 database schema:

**1. Querying Gene Data:**

```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,  -- Assuming 'gene' is the feature type for genes
    end - start + 1 AS gene_size -- Calculate gene size (end - start)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

* **`seqid = 'X'`:**  Filters for features on the X chromosome.
* **`featuretype = 'gene'`:** Filters for genes specifically.
* **`end - start + 1 AS gene_size`:** Calculates the size of each gene by subtracting the start position from the end position and adding 1 (to include both ends).

**2. Exporting Data for Plotting:**

You'll need to export the results of this query into a format suitable for plotting.  Here are some options:

* **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       gene_size
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene'
   INTO '/path/to/your/x_chromosome_genes.csv'; -- Replace with your desired file path
   ```

* **Other Formats:** You can also export to formats like TSV (Tab-Separated Values) or JSON, depending on your plotting tool's preferences.

**3. Using a Plotting Tool:**

Once you have the data exported, use a plotting tool of your choice (e.g., Python with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, R, Excel, etc.) to create a scatterplot. 

* **X-axis:** Gene size
* **Y-axis:**  You can leave this axis empty for a simple distribution plot, or add other relevant information if needed (e.g., gene density).
