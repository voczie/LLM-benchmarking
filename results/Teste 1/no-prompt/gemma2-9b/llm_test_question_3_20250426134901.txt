Here's how you can find the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome using your SQLite database schema:

**1.  Identify Pseudogenes:**

*   You need to determine how "pseudogene" is represented in your `attributes` column. 
    *   Look for a specific attribute like `"gene_type": "pseudogene"` or something similar.

**2. Filter by Chromosome:**

*   Use the `seqid` column to filter for entries on the X chromosome.  Assume your database uses "X" as the identifier for the X chromosome.

**3. Count the Results:**

*   Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of rows that meet both criteria (pseudogene type and X chromosome location).

**Example Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'X' 
  AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_type": "pseudogene"%'; -- Adjust the LIKE pattern based on your attribute representation
```

**Explanation:**

*   `SELECT COUNT(*)`: Counts all rows that match the conditions.
*   `FROM features`: Specifies the table to query.
*   `WHERE seqid = 'X'`: Filters for entries on the X chromosome.
*   `AND attributes LIKE '%"gene_type": "pseudogene"%'`:  Filters for entries where the `attributes` column contains the string `"gene_type": "pseudogene"` (adjust this pattern if your attribute representation is different).

**Important Notes:**

*   Replace `"gene_type": "pseudogene"` with the actual attribute value used to identify pseudogenes in your database.
*   The `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) allows for flexibility in matching attribute values.
