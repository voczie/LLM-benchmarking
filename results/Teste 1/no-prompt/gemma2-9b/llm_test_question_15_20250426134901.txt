Here's how you can find genes located between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on both positive (+) and negative (-) strands using SQL queries against your GFF/GTF database:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to identify features (likely genes) that fall within a specific genomic region defined by HOXC11 and HOXC12.  The key is to consider both strands (+ and -) since gene orientation can vary.

**SQL Queries**

```sql
-- Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the + strand
SELECT * 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_id' -- Replace with your actual genome ID
  AND featuretype = 'gene' -- Adjust if you have a different feature type for genes
  AND start BETWEEN (SELECT end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11') AND (SELECT end FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12')
  AND strand = '+'

-- Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12 on the - strand
SELECT * 
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_id' -- Replace with your actual genome ID
  AND featuretype = 'gene' -- Adjust if you have a different feature type for genes
  AND end BETWEEN (SELECT start FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC11') AND (SELECT start FROM features WHERE id = 'HOXC12')
  AND strand = '-';

```

**Explanation:**

* **`seqid`**: Replace `'your_genome_sequence_id'` with the actual ID of your genome sequence in the database.
* **`featuretype`**: Adjust `'gene'` if your database uses a different term for genes (e.g., 'CDS', 'transcript').
* **`start` and `end`**: We use subqueries to find the exact start and end positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12 in the `features` table. Then, we compare the `start` and `end` values of other features within these ranges.
* **`strand`**:  We filter for either `'+'` (positive strand) or `'-'` (negative strand) to get the desired orientation.

**Important Notes:**

* **Database Structure**: Make sure your database schema matches the one you provided. Adjust table and column names accordingly if necessary.
* **Genome ID**: Replace `'your_genome_sequence_id'` with the correct ID for your genome in the database.
