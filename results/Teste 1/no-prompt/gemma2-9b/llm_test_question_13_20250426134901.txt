```sql
SELECT attributes 
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2');
```

**Walkthrough:**

1. **`SELECT attributes`**: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the `attributes` column from the `features` table. The `attributes` column often contains information about the gene, including its biotype.

2. **`FROM features`**: This indicates that we are querying the `features` table, which stores genomic feature annotations.

3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: This filters the results to only include rows where the `featuretype` is 'gene'. This ensures we are looking at gene entries and not other types of features like transcripts or regulatory regions.

4. **`AND id IN ('XIST', 'MALAT1', 'BRCA1', 'NFKB1', 'NFKB2', 'REL', 'RELA', 'RELB', 'COL1A2')`**: This further filters the results to include only the specific genes you are interested in: XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, RELB, and COL1A2.

**Output:**

The query will return a result set where each row corresponds to one of the specified genes. The `attributes` column for each row will contain information about that gene, including its biotype. You can then parse this information to determine the biotype of each gene.
