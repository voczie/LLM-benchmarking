```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    end - start + 1 AS gene_size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND (
    -- Check for each gene individually
    (seqid = 'XIST') OR 
    (seqid = 'MALAT1') OR 
    (seqid = 'BRCA1') OR 
    (seqid = 'COL1A2') OR 
    (seqid = 'NFKB1') OR 
    (seqid = 'NFKB2') OR 
    (seqid = 'REL') OR 
    (seqid = 'RELA') OR 
    (seqid = 'RELB')
  )
ORDER BY featuretype;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT featuretype, end - start + 1 AS gene_size`**: This selects the `featuretype` (which should be 'gene' for our target features) and calculates the size of each feature as `end - start + 1`.
2. **`FROM features`**:  Specifies that we are querying the `features` table.
3. **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: Filters the results to include only rows where the `featuretype` is 'gene'.
4. **`AND ( ... )`**: This clause uses OR conditions to check for each gene individually:
   - Replace `'XIST'`, `'MALAT1'`, etc., with the actual sequence IDs of your genes in the database.

**Important Notes:**

* **Sequence IDs:** Make sure the `seqid` values in your query match the actual sequence IDs used in your database for each gene.
* **Database Structure:** This query assumes that your `features` table has columns named `start`, `end`, and `featuretype`. Adjust column names if they are different in your schema.
