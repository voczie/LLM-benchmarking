Here's how you can find the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using your SQLite3 database schema:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr12' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%';
```

**Explanation:**

* **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet the specified criteria.
* **`FROM features`**:  We are querying the `features` table where gene annotation data is stored.
* **`WHERE seqid = 'chr12'`**: This filters for features located on chromosome 12. Remember to adjust this if your chromosomes are named differently.
* **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**:  This ensures we're only counting genes, not other genomic features like transcripts or regulatory elements.
* **`AND attributes LIKE '%protein_coding%'`**: This is the key part. It filters for genes that have the string "protein_coding" within their `attributes` field. The `LIKE` operator with the wildcard '%' allows us to match any gene with this attribute, regardless of its exact format.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:**  The specific way "protein_coding" is represented in the `attributes` field might vary depending on your annotation source and conventions. You might need to adjust the `LIKE` clause accordingly if it's stored differently (e.g., as a separate key-value pair).
* **Chromosome Naming:** Replace 'chr12' with the actual name of chromosome 12 in your database if it's different.
