Here's how you can query your SQLite database to find the number of exons per transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.attributes, -- This will contain the transcript name
    COUNT(DISTINCT f2.id) AS exon_count
FROM features f
JOIN features f2 ON f.id = f2.parent AND f2.featuretype = 'exon'
WHERE f.featuretype = 'transcript' 
  AND f.seqid = 'BRCA1' -- Assuming BRCA1 is stored in a specific seqid
GROUP BY f.attributes;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT f.attributes, COUNT(DISTINCT f2.id) AS exon_count`**: This selects the transcript name (stored within the `attributes` field of the main feature) and calculates the number of distinct exons for each transcript.

2. **`FROM features f JOIN features f2 ON f.id = f2.parent AND f2.featuretype = 'exon'`**: This joins the `features` table with itself to link transcripts (main features) to their corresponding exons. The join condition ensures that:
   -  `f.id` (transcript ID) matches `f2.parent` (exon's parent feature).
   -  `f2.featuretype` is 'exon', indicating we are dealing with exon features.

3. **`WHERE f.featuretype = 'transcript' AND f.seqid = 'BRCA1'`**: This filters the results to include only:
   - Features of type 'transcript'.
   - Features belonging to the `BRCA1` sequence (adjust this if your BRCA1 gene is stored under a different seqid).

4. **`GROUP BY f.attributes`**: This groups the results by the transcript name (`f.attributes`), allowing us to count exons for each unique transcript.



**Output:**

The query will output a table with two columns:

- `transcript_name`: The name of each BRCA1 transcript isoform.
- `exon_count`: The number of exons associated with each transcript isoform.
