Here's how you can find the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10 using your SQLite3 database schema:

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr10' AND featuretype = 'miRNA';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This part of the query instructs SQLite to count all rows that meet the specified criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**:  We are querying the `features` table, which stores information about genomic features.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'chr10'`**: This filters the results to include only features located on chromosome 10. Remember to adjust this if your database uses a different naming convention for chromosomes.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'miRNA'`**: This further refines the results to count only features classified as 'miRNA'.

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Connect to your SQLite3 database.** Use a tool like `sqlite3` in your terminal or a GUI database client.
2. **Execute the query:** Paste the SQL query into your database interface and run it.
3. **Interpret the result:** The query will return a single number representing the total count of miRNA genes found on chromosome 10 in your database.
