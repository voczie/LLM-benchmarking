Here's how you can find the number of transcript isoforms for the XIST gene and their sizes using a SQLite3 query:

```sql
SELECT 
    attributes, -- This will contain the transcript_name attribute
    (end - start + 1) AS size  -- Calculate the size of each transcript isoform
FROM features
WHERE 
    seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_ID' -- Replace with the actual ID for your genome sequence
    AND featuretype = 'transcript' -- Filter for transcripts
    AND attributes LIKE '%gene%XIST%' --  Filter for XIST gene transcripts
ORDER BY 
    attributes; -- Order by transcript name for readability
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT attributes, (end - start + 1) AS size`**: This selects two columns:
   - `attributes`: This column stores the various attributes associated with each feature, including the transcript name. We'll use this to identify the isoforms.
   - `(end - start + 1) AS size`: This calculates the size of each transcript isoform by subtracting the starting position (`start`) from the ending position (`end`) and adding 1.

2. **`FROM features`**:  This specifies that we're querying the `features` table, which contains your genome annotation data.

3. **`WHERE seqid = 'your_genome_sequence_ID'`**: Replace `'your_genome_sequence_ID'` with the actual ID for your genome sequence in the database.

4. **`AND featuretype = 'transcript'`**: This filters the results to include only features of type "transcript".

5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%gene%XIST%'`**: This filters further to select transcripts that have the attribute `gene=XIST`.  The `LIKE` operator with the wildcard `%` allows for variations in how the gene name is stored within the `attributes` column.

6. **`ORDER BY attributes`**: This sorts the results alphabetically by the `attributes` column, making it easier to see the different transcript isoforms.



**Important Notes:**

*  Make sure you've replaced `'your_genome_sequence_ID'` with the correct ID for your genome sequence in the database.
* The exact format of the `attributes` column and how the gene name is stored within it might vary depending on your annotation source. You may need to adjust the `LIKE` condition accordingly.
