Here's how you can find the number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 using your SQLite3 database schema:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr7' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(*)`**: This counts all rows that meet the specified criteria.
2. **`FROM features`**:  We're querying the `features` table where gene annotation data is stored.
3. **`WHERE seqid = 'chr7'`**:  This filters for features located on chromosome 7. Remember to adjust this if your database uses a different naming convention for chromosomes.
4. **`AND featuretype = 'gene'`**: This further narrows down the results to only gene features.
5. **`AND attributes LIKE '%lncRNA%'`**: This is the key part. We're using `LIKE` with the wildcard '%' to search for any feature where the `attributes` field contains the string "lncRNA".  This assumes that lncRNA information is stored within the `attributes` field of your gene annotations.

**Important Notes:**

* **Attribute Format:** The exact format of the `attributes` field will determine how you search for lncRNA information. If it's a structured format (e.g., key-value pairs), you might need to use more specific SQL queries.
* **Database Conventions:**  Double-check your database schema and naming conventions for chromosomes, feature types, and attribute fields.
