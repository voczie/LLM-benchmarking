To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3, you can use SQL queries that filter by `seqid` (chromosome) and `featuretype`. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Identify the relevant rows for genes:**
   - Genes typically have the feature type "gene".
   
2. **Identify the relevant rows for transcripts:**
   - Transcripts typically have the feature type "transcript".

3. **Filter by chromosome 3 (`seqid = 'chr3'` or `seqid = '3'`, depending on how your data is stored):**

4. **Count the number of genes and transcripts separately, then combine the results:**

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Counting genes on chromosome 3
SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene';

-- Counting transcripts on chromosome 3
SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'transcript';
```

If you want to combine these counts into a single result, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene') AS gene_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'transcript') AS transcript_count;
```

This will return a single row with two columns: `gene_count` and `transcript_count`, showing the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3, respectively.

### Explanation:
- **seqid**: This column contains the identifier for each sequence (e.g., chromosome or scaffold).
- **featuretype**: This column specifies the type of feature (e.g., gene, transcript).

Make sure to replace `'chr3'` with the actual name used in your database if it's different. For example, some databases might use `3`, `Chromosome_3`, etc.

### Additional Notes:
- If you have a large dataset and performance is an issue, consider indexing the columns involved in filtering (`seqid`, `featuretype`) to speed up query execution.
- Ensure that your database schema matches exactly with what's described here or adjust the queries accordingly.
