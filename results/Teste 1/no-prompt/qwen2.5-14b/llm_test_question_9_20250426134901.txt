To find the average exon size for the BRCA1 transcript isoforms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all exons that belong to transcripts of the BRCA1 gene.
2. Calculate the length (size) of each exon.
3. Compute the average size of these exons.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this using SQL queries with your SQLite database schema.

### Step 1: Identify Exons Belonging to BRCA1 Transcripts

First, we need to find all transcripts that belong to the BRCA1 gene. Then, we will identify exons that are children of these transcripts.

```sql
-- Find all transcript IDs for BRCA1 gene
WITH brca1_transcripts AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT T2.child AS transcript_id
    FROM relations AS R1
    JOIN features AS F1 ON R1.parent = F1.id
    JOIN relations AS R2 ON R2.parent = F1.id AND R2.level = 0 -- Assuming level 0 is the gene
    JOIN features AS F2 ON R2.child = F2.id
    WHERE F1.featuretype = 'gene' AND F2.featuretype = 'transcript'
      AND F2.attributes LIKE '%Name=BRCA1%' -- Adjust this based on how BRCA1 is annotated in your database
)
-- Find all exons that are children of these transcripts
SELECT DISTINCT T3.child AS exon_id, F3.start, F3.end
FROM relations AS R3
JOIN brca1_transcripts AS BT ON R3.parent = BT.transcript_id AND R3.level = 1 -- Assuming level 1 is the transcript to exon relationship
JOIN features AS F3 ON R3.child = F3.id
WHERE F3.featuretype = 'exon';
```

### Step 2: Calculate Exon Lengths

Next, we calculate the length of each exon.

```sql
WITH brca1_exons AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT T3.child AS exon_id, F3.start, F3.end
    FROM relations AS R3
    JOIN brca1_transcripts AS BT ON R3.parent = BT.transcript_id AND R3.level = 1 -- Assuming level 1 is the transcript to exon relationship
    JOIN features AS F3 ON R3.child = F3.id
    WHERE F3.featuretype = 'exon'
)
SELECT exon_id, (end - start + 1) AS length FROM brca1_exons;
```

### Step 3: Compute Average Exon Size

Finally, we compute the average size of these exons.

```sql
WITH brca1_exons AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT T3.child AS exon_id, F3.start, F3.end
    FROM relations AS R3
    JOIN brca1_transcripts AS BT ON R3.parent = BT.transcript_id AND R3.level = 1 -- Assuming level 1 is the transcript to exon relationship
    JOIN features AS F3 ON R3.child = F3.id
    WHERE F3.featuretype = 'exon'
),
lengths AS (
    SELECT exon_id, (end - start + 1) AS length FROM brca1_exons
)
SELECT AVG(length) AS average_exon_size FROM lengths;
```

### Explanation

- **brca1_transcripts**: This CTE finds all transcript IDs that belong to the BRCA1 gene.
- **brca1_exons**: This CTE identifies exons that are children of these transcripts.
- **lengths**: This CTE calculates the length of each exon.
- The final query computes the average length of these exons.

Make sure to adjust the `LIKE` condition in the first part of the query if your database uses a different naming convention for the BRCA1 gene.
