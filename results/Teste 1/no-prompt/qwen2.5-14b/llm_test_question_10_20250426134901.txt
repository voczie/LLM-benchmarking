To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene in your SQLite database, you need to extract information from the `features` table where the attributes include the gene name "BRCA1". The `attributes` column typically contains key-value pairs that describe various aspects of the feature. For genes, this often includes a field like `gene_id` or `Name`.

Here's how you can write a query to find the chromosomal position (i.e., the start and end positions) of the BRCA1 gene:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Identify the Gene Name in Attributes:**
   The attributes column usually contains information about the feature, such as `gene_id`, `Name`, etc. You need to identify how the gene name is stored.

2. **Construct a Query to Extract BRCA1 Information:**
   Assuming that the gene name "BRCA1" is stored under an attribute like `Name` or `gene_name`, you can use SQL's `LIKE` operator to search for it within the attributes column.

3. **Extract Start and End Positions:**
   Once you have identified the row corresponding to BRCA1, extract the start (`start`) and end (`end`) positions from that row.

### Example Query

Let's assume that "BRCA1" is stored in an attribute called `Name`. The query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%Name="BRCA1"%';
```

If the gene name is stored under a different key (e.g., `gene_id`), you might need to adjust the query accordingly. For example, if "BRCA1" is stored as `gene_id`, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id="BRCA1"%';
```

### Explanation

- **`seqid`:** This column represents the chromosome or scaffold where the gene is located.
- **`start`:** The starting position of the BRCA1 gene on the chromosome.
- **`end`:** The ending position of the BRCA1 gene on the chromosome.

If there are multiple entries for "BRCA1" (e.g., different transcripts), you might want to filter further based on `featuretype` or other attributes to get specific information about the gene itself rather than its transcripts or exons.

### Additional Considerations

- **Feature Type:** If your database distinguishes between genes and their transcripts, you may need to specify that you are looking for a gene feature type. For example:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%Name="BRCA1"%'
AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

- **Handling Multiple Matches:** If there are multiple matches (e.g., different transcripts or isoforms), you might want to filter further based on the specific type of feature you're interested in.

This query should give you the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene. Adjust the attribute name and filtering criteria as necessary based on your database schema and data structure.
