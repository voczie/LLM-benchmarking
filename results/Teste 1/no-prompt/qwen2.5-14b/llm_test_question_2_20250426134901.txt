To determine how many long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are located on chromosome 7, you can use SQL queries to extract and count relevant entries from your SQLite database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the relevant table**: The `features` table contains information about all genomic features.

2. **Filter by feature type**: You need to filter for lncRNA genes. Assuming that lncRNAs are annotated as "lnc_RNA" or similar in your database, you can use a query to find these entries.

3. **Filter by chromosome**: You want to count only those lncRNA genes on chromosome 7 (assuming `seqid` is the column for chromosome names).

4. **Count the filtered results**.

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'lnc_RNA' AND seqid = 'chr7';
```

### Explanation:
- `featuretype = 'lnc_RNA'`: This condition filters the rows to only include those where the feature type is "lnc_RNA".
- `seqid = 'chr7'`: This condition ensures that we are counting features on chromosome 7. Note that depending on your database, the exact string for chromosome 7 might be different (e.g., `chr7`, `Chromosome_7`, etc.). You should verify this in your data.
- `COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count`: This counts all rows matching the conditions and labels the result as `lncrna_count`.

### Steps to Execute:
1. **Connect to the SQLite database** using a tool like `sqlite3` command-line interface or any programming language that supports SQLite (e.g., Python with sqlite3 module).
2. **Run the query**: Copy and paste the above SQL statement into your SQLite environment.
3. **Interpret the result**: The output will be a single number representing how many lncRNA genes are on chromosome 7.

### Example in Python:
If you prefer to run this using Python, here's an example:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS lncrna_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'lnc_RNA' AND seqid = 'chr7';
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the result
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.

This query will give you the count of lncRNA genes specifically located on chromosome 7.
