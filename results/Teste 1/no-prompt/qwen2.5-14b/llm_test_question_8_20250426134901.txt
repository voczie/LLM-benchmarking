To answer the question "How many exons does each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene have?", you need to query your SQLite database in a way that links `features` with their relationships through the `relations` table. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Identify Transcript and Exon Features:**
   - First, identify all features of type "transcript" for the BRCA1 gene.
   - Then, find all exons that are children of these transcripts.

2. **Join Tables to Get Relationships:**
   - Use the `relations` table to link each transcript with its child exons.
   
3. **Aggregate Data:**
   - Count the number of exons for each transcript.
   - Retrieve the transcript name from attributes.

### SQL Query

Here is a query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH brca1_transcripts AS (
    SELECT id, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid LIKE '%BRCA1%'
),
exon_relations AS (
    SELECT r.child as exon_id, t.id as transcript_id
    FROM relations r
    JOIN brca1_transcripts t ON r.parent = t.id
    WHERE r.level = 0 -- Assuming level 0 represents direct children (exons)
),
transcript_exon_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        tr.id as transcript_id,
        COUNT(er.exon_id) as exon_count,
        json_extract(tr.attributes, '$.transcript_name') as transcript_name
    FROM brca1_transcripts tr
    LEFT JOIN exon_relations er ON tr.id = er.transcript_id
    GROUP BY tr.id
)
SELECT 
    transcript_name,
    exon_count
FROM transcript_exon_counts;
```

### Explanation

- **brca1_transcripts CTE:** This common table expression (CTE) selects all features of type "transcript" for the BRCA1 gene.
  
- **exon_relations CTE:** This CTE joins `relations` with `brca1_transcripts` to find exons that are direct children (`level = 0`) of each transcript.

- **transcript_exon_counts CTE:** This CTE counts the number of exons for each transcript and extracts the transcript name from the attributes using JSON functions (assuming the attribute is stored in a JSON format).

- The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the transcript names and their corresponding exon counts.

### Notes

1. **JSON Path Extraction:**
   - If your database does not support JSON path extraction, you may need to adjust how you extract the `transcript_name`. For example, if attributes are stored as a string in key-value pairs, you might use string functions like `SUBSTR` and `INSTR`.

2. **BRCA1 Gene Identification:**
   - The query assumes that BRCA1 gene is uniquely identifiable by its sequence ID (`seqid`). If the gene name or other criteria need to be used for identification, adjust the WHERE clause accordingly.

3. **Level Definition:**
   - Ensure that `level = 0` correctly represents direct children (exons) in your data model. Adjust if necessary based on your specific schema and data structure.

This query should give you a list of transcript names along with their exon counts for the BRCA1 gene.
