To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome, you can use SQL queries to extract and count relevant entries from your SQLite database. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify Relevant Rows in `features` Table**: You need to find rows where `seqid` is 'X' (or whatever identifier represents the X chromosome) and `featuretype` is 'pseudogene'.

2. **Count These Rows**: Once you have identified these rows, count them.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogenes_count 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene';
```

### Explanation:
- `seqid = 'X'`: Filters the entries to only those on the X chromosome.
- `featuretype = 'pseudogene'`: Ensures that we are counting only pseudogenes.
- `COUNT(*) AS pseudogenes_count`: Counts all rows matching these criteria and labels this count as `pseudogenes_count`.

### Steps to Execute:
1. **Connect to Your SQLite Database**: Use a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, or connect via Python with libraries such as sqlite3.

2. **Run the Query**:
   - Open your database connection.
   - Run the above SQL query.
   - Fetch and display the result which will be the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

### Example in Python (Optional):
If you prefer to run this via a script, here's an example using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to your SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogenes_count 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene';
"""

cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Number of pseudogenes on X chromosome: {result[0]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

Replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file name.

This query will give you a precise count of how many pseudogenes are present on the X chromosome in your genome annotation data.
