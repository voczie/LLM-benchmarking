To generate a boxplot representing the comparison of `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcript sizes from your SQLite database, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Transcript Sizes**: First, extract the sizes (length) of transcripts for each type (`protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, `miRNA`). This involves querying the `features` table where the `featuretype` is one of those transcript types and calculating the length as `(end - start + 1)`.

2. **Aggregate Data**: Aggregate the sizes by transcript type to prepare for plotting.

3. **Export Data**: Export the aggregated data into a format that can be used with a plotting library (like pandas in Python).

4. **Plotting**: Use a plotting library like matplotlib or seaborn to generate the boxplot.

Here's how you could do it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Extract Transcript Sizes

First, let's write a query to extract transcript sizes for each type of transcript (`protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA`).

```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype IN ('transcript', 'mRNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'lnc_RNA' OR attributes LIKE '%transcript_biotype="lncRNA"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype IN ('miRNA', 'misc_RNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%';
```

### Step 2: Aggregate Data

Since the above query will return individual transcript lengths, you need to aggregate these lengths by type. You can do this in SQL or after exporting data into Python.

```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    AVG(length) AS avg_length,
    MIN(length) AS min_length,
    MAX(length) AS max_length,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER () AS q1,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY length) OVER () AS q3
FROM (
    SELECT 
        featuretype,
        (end - start + 1) AS length
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype IN ('transcript', 'mRNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        featuretype,
        (end - start + 1) AS length
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'lnc_RNA' OR attributes LIKE '%transcript_biotype="lncRNA"%'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        featuretype,
        (end - start + 1) AS length
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype IN ('miRNA', 'misc_RNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%'
)
GROUP BY featuretype;
```

### Step 3: Export Data

Export the data from SQLite to a CSV file or directly into Python for plotting.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to your database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Query and load data into DataFrame
query = """
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype IN ('transcript', 'mRNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="protein_coding"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'lnc_RNA' OR attributes LIKE '%transcript_biotype="lncRNA"%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS length
FROM features
WHERE featuretype IN ('miRNA', 'misc_RNA') AND attributes LIKE '%transcript_type="miRNA"%';
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# Aggregate data for boxplot
box_data = df.groupby('featuretype')['length'].apply(list).reset_index(name='lengths')
```

### Step 4: Plotting

Now that you have your data in a DataFrame, use seaborn to create a boxplot.

```python
sns.boxplot(x='featuretype', y='length', data=df)
plt.title("Comparison of Transcript Sizes")
plt.xlabel("Transcript Type")
plt.ylabel("Length (bp)")
plt.show()
```

This will generate a boxplot comparing the sizes of `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcripts. Adjust the SQL queries as necessary to fit your exact data schema and attributes if needed.
