To find which genes are located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both the positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the positions of HOXC11 and HOXC12

First, we need to identify the start and end coordinates for `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`. We will query the database to get their positions.

```sql
SELECT seqid, strand, MIN(start) AS min_start, MAX(end) AS max_end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%')
GROUP BY seqid, strand;
```

This query will give you the positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on each chromosome and strand.

### Step 2: Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12

Once we have the coordinates for `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`, we can use them to find other genes located between these two genes. We will need to do this separately for the positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) strands.

#### For Positive Strand (+):

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT seqid, strand, MIN(start) AS min_start, MAX(end) AS max_end 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
)
SELECT f.id, f.seqid, f.start, f.end, f.strand, f.featuretype, f.attributes 
FROM features AS f
JOIN hoxc_positions AS hp ON f.seqid = hp.seqid AND f.strand = hp.strand
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND f.strand = '+' AND 
      (f.start > hp.min_start AND f.end < hp.max_end) AND 
      NOT (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%');
```

#### For Negative Strand (-):

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT seqid, strand, MIN(start) AS min_start, MAX(end) AS max_end 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
)
SELECT f.id, f.seqid, f.start, f.end, f.strand, f.featuretype, f.attributes 
FROM features AS f
JOIN hoxc_positions AS hp ON f.seqid = hp.seqid AND f.strand = hp.strand
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND f.strand = '-' AND 
      (f.start > hp.min_start AND f.end < hp.max_end) AND 
      NOT (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%');
```

### Explanation:

- **hoxc_positions CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) finds the positions of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.
- **Main Query**:
  - Joins the features with the hoxc_positions to filter genes on the same chromosome and strand.
  - Filters for genes that are between the start and end coordinates of `HOXC11` and `HOXC12`.
  - Excludes `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` themselves from the results.

### Step 3: Combine Results

You can combine the results from both queries to get a complete list of genes between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands:

```sql
WITH hoxc_positions AS (
    SELECT seqid, strand, MIN(start) AS min_start, MAX(end) AS max_end 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%')
    GROUP BY seqid, strand
)
SELECT f.id, f.seqid, f.start, f.end, f.strand, f.featuretype, f.attributes 
FROM features AS f
JOIN hoxc_positions AS hp ON f.seqid = hp.seqid AND f.strand = hp.strand
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
      (f.strand = '+' OR f.strand = '-') AND 
      (f.start > hp.min_start AND f.end < hp.max_end) AND 
      NOT (attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%ID=HOXC12%');
```

This combined query will give you the genes located between `HOXC11` and `HOXC12` on both strands.
