To find the names of the two genes located immediately before and after the gene `COL1A2`, you need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 1. Identify the Gene `COL1A2`
First, we need to identify the location (chromosome and start/end positions) of the gene `COL1A2` in the database.

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=COL1A2%;'
```

This query will return the chromosome (`seqid`) and position (`start`, `end`) of the gene `COL1A2`. The `attributes` column contains additional information about the gene, including its ID.

#### 2. Extract Gene IDs from Attributes
The `attributes` field is a text string that typically includes key-value pairs like `ID=COL1A2;Name=gene_name;...`. We need to extract the actual gene name if it's different from `COL1A2`.

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end, 
       SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(attributes, ';', INSTR(attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=COL1A2%;'
```

This query extracts the `Name` attribute from the `attributes` field.

#### 3. Find Genes Before and After COL1A2
Once we have the chromosome (`seqid`) and position of `COL1A2`, we can find genes located immediately before and after it on the same chromosome.

```sql
WITH col1a2_info AS (
    SELECT seqid, start as col1a2_start, end as col1a2_end,
           SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(attributes, ';', INSTR(attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=COL1A2%;'
)
SELECT f.seqid, f.start, f.end,
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(f.attributes, ';', INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
FROM features f, col1a2_info c
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
      f.seqid = c.seqid AND 
      (f.start < c.col1a2_start AND f.end > c.col1a2_start OR 
       f.start < c.col1a2_end AND f.end > c.col1a2_end)
ORDER BY ABS(f.start - c.col1a2_start) ASC, ABS(f.end - c.col1a2_end) ASC
LIMIT 2;
```

This query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the `COL1A2` gene's details. Then it selects genes that overlap with or are immediately adjacent to `COL1A2`. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures we get the closest genes based on their start and end positions relative to `COL1A2`.

#### 4. Filter for Immediate Neighbors
To ensure we only get the immediate neighbors, you might need to filter out any overlapping genes or those that are too far away.

```sql
WITH col1a2_info AS (
    SELECT seqid, start as col1a2_start, end as col1a2_end,
           SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(attributes, ';', INSTR(attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=COL1A2%;'
)
SELECT f.seqid, f.start, f.end,
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(f.attributes, ';', INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
FROM features f, col1a2_info c
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
      f.seqid = c.seqid AND 
      (f.start < c.col1a2_start AND f.end > c.col1a2_start OR 
       f.start < c.col1a2_end AND f.end > c.col1a2_end)
ORDER BY ABS(f.start - c.col1a2_start) ASC, ABS(f.end - c.col1a2_end) ASC
LIMIT 2;
```

This query should give you the names of the two genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`.

### Final Query

```sql
WITH col1a2_info AS (
    SELECT seqid, start as col1a2_start, end as col1a2_end,
           SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(attributes, ';', INSTR(attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=COL1A2%;'
)
SELECT f.seqid, f.start, f.end,
       SUBSTR(f.attributes, INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') + 5, INSTR(f.attributes, ';', INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=')) - INSTR(f.attributes, 'Name=') - 5) AS gene_name
FROM features f, col1a2_info c
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene' AND 
      f.seqid = c.seqid AND 
      (f.start < c.col1a2_start AND f.end > c.col1a2_start OR 
       f.start < c.col1a2_end AND f.end > c.col1a2_end)
ORDER BY ABS(f.start - c.col1a2_start) ASC, ABS(f.end - c.col1a2_end) ASC
LIMIT 2;
```

This query should provide the names of the two genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`.
