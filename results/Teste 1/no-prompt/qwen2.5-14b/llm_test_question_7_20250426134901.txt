To determine how many exons the XIST gene has, you need to perform a few steps:

1. Identify the ID of the XIST gene in the `features` table.
2. Find all exons that are related to this gene using the `relations` table.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the Gene ID
First, you need to find the ID of the XIST gene. You can do this by querying the `features` table for entries where `featuretype` is 'gene' and `attributes` contain information about the gene name.

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name="XIST"%';
```

Let's assume that the query returns a single ID, say `XIST_ID`.

### Step 2: Find Exons Related to XIST Gene
Now you need to find all exons related to this gene. You can do this by querying the `relations` table for entries where `parent` is the ID of the XIST gene and `level` indicates that these are exons.

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_ID' AND level = 1;
```

The `level` value might vary depending on how your data is structured, but typically a level of 1 would indicate direct children (exons in this case).

### Step 3: Count the Number of Exons
Finally, you can count the number of exons by counting the rows returned from the previous query.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(child) 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_ID' AND level = 1;
```

This will give you the total number of exons associated with the XIST gene.

### Putting It All Together

Here is a complete SQL script that combines all these steps:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find the ID of the XIST gene
WITH xist_gene AS (
    SELECT id 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%Name="XIST"%'
)

-- Step 2 & 3: Count the number of exons related to this gene
SELECT COUNT(child) 
FROM relations, xist_gene 
WHERE parent = xist_gene.id AND level = 1;
```

This script first finds the ID of the XIST gene and then counts how many exons are associated with it. Make sure that your `attributes` field is correctly formatted to include the gene name in a way that allows this query to work.

If you have multiple genes named "XIST" or if there's any ambiguity, you might need to refine the search criteria further based on additional attributes like chromosome location (`seqid`) or other unique identifiers.
