To determine which strand the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes are located on using the provided SQLite database schema, you can write a SQL query to extract this information from the `features` table. The `strand` column in the `features` table contains the strand information for each feature.

Here's how you could structure your query:

```sql
SELECT id, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE id IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12');
```

This SQL statement selects the gene IDs and their corresponding strands from the `features` table where the ID matches one of the genes you're interested in (HOTAIR, HOXC11, or HOXC12).

### Steps to Execute the Query

1. **Connect to the SQLite Database:**
   You need to connect to your SQLite database using a tool like `sqlite3`, Python with `sqlite3` module, or any other SQL client that supports SQLite.

2. **Run the Query:**

```sql
-- Connect to the database (example command for sqlite3)
$ sqlite3 my_genome_annotation.db

-- Execute the query
SELECT id, strand 
FROM features 
WHERE id IN ('HOTAIR', 'HOXC11', 'HOXC12');
```

### Example Output Interpretation:

If you run this query and get results like:

```plaintext
ID         STRAND
---------- -------
HOTAIR     +
HOXC11     -
HOXC12     -
```

This means:
- The HOTAIR gene is located on the positive strand (+).
- Both HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes are located on the negative strand (-).

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure that the IDs in your query exactly match those stored in the database.
- If you have a large dataset, consider indexing the `id` column for faster queries.

This should give you the information about which strands these specific genes are located on.
