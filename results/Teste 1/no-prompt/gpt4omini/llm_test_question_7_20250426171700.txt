To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Gene ID for XIST**: First, you need to find the ID of the XIST gene in the `features` table. The `featuretype` for genes is typically "gene".

2. **Find Exons Associated with the XIST Gene**: Once you have the gene ID for XIST, you can query the `features` table again to count the number of exons associated with that gene. The `featuretype` for exons is typically "exon".

3. **Construct the SQL Queries**: You will need to write SQL queries to perform the above steps.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Find the Gene ID for XIST

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'XIST' AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Step 2: Count the Exons for the XIST Gene

Assuming you found the gene ID from the previous query (let's say it's `gene_id`), you can count the exons like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS exon_count 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id="gene_id"%'
AND featuretype = 'exon';
```

### Complete Query

You can combine these steps into a single query using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS exon_count 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_id=(SELECT id FROM features WHERE seqid = 'XIST' AND featuretype = 'gene')%';
```

### Explanation of the Query

- The outer query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'exon'.
- The inner subquery retrieves the `id` of the XIST gene.
- The `LIKE` clause in the outer query checks if the `attributes` field contains the gene ID of XIST.

### Execute the Query

Run the complete query in your SQLite database environment. The result will give you the number of exons associated with the XIST gene.

### Note

Make sure to adjust the `LIKE` clause based on how the `attributes` field is formatted in your database. The example assumes a common format but may need to be tailored to your specific data.
