To find the names of the two genes located immediately before and after the gene COL1A2 in a GFF/GTF format stored in a SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Location of COL1A2**: First, you need to find the start and end positions of the gene COL1A2.

2. **Find Neighboring Genes**: Next, you will query the database to find genes that are located immediately before and after COL1A2 based on their start and end positions.

Hereâ€™s how you can construct the SQL queries to achieve this:

### Step 1: Find the Position of COL1A2

You can use the following SQL query to get the start and end positions of the gene COL1A2:

```sql
SELECT start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%';
```

### Step 2: Find the Genes Immediately Before and After COL1A2

Assuming you have the start and end positions from the previous query, you can use those values to find the neighboring genes. Let's say the start position is `start_pos` and the end position is `end_pos`. You can use the following queries:

#### Find the Gene Immediately Before COL1A2

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%')
AND end < (SELECT start FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%')
ORDER BY end DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

#### Find the Gene Immediately After COL1A2

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND seqid = (SELECT seqid FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%')
AND start > (SELECT end FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%COL1A2%')
ORDER BY start ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Combine the Results

You can run the above two queries separately to get the names of the genes immediately before and after COL1A2. If you want to combine the results into a single output, you can use a UNION or run them in your application logic.

### Example of Combined Query

If you want to get both results in one go, you can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subqueries, but it might be more straightforward to run them separately due to the nature of the queries.

### Final Note

Make sure to replace `id` in the SELECT statements with the appropriate column that contains the gene names if they are stored differently in your database. The `attributes` field typically contains gene names in GFF/GTF files, so you might need to parse it accordingly.
