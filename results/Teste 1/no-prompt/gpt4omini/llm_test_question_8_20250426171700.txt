To answer the question of how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, you will need to perform a series of SQL queries on the SQLite database that contains the genome annotation data. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to constructing the necessary SQL query:

### Step 1: Identify the BRCA1 Gene
First, you need to find the `id` of the BRCA1 gene in the `features` table. Typically, the gene will be represented as a feature type (e.g., "gene"). You can retrieve the gene's ID using the following query:

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms of BRCA1
Once you have the gene ID for BRCA1, you can find its associated transcript isoforms. Transcript isoforms are usually represented as "mRNA" or "transcript" in the `featuretype` column. You can use the gene ID obtained from the previous query to find the transcript isoforms:

```sql
SELECT f.id AS transcript_id, f.attributes 
FROM features f
JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child
WHERE r.parent = '<BRCA1_gene_id>' 
AND f.featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript');
```

Replace `<BRCA1_gene_id>` with the actual ID you retrieved in Step 1.

### Step 3: Count Exons for Each Transcript Isoform
Now that you have the transcript isoforms, you can count the number of exons associated with each transcript. Exons are typically represented as "exon" in the `featuretype` column. You can use the transcript IDs obtained in Step 2 to count the exons:

```sql
SELECT t.attributes AS transcript_name, COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM features e
JOIN relations r ON e.id = r.child
JOIN features t ON r.parent = t.id
WHERE t.featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript') 
AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
AND t.id IN (
    SELECT f.id 
    FROM features f
    JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child
    WHERE r.parent = '<BRCA1_gene_id>' 
    AND f.featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript')
)
GROUP BY t.id;
```

### Final Query
Combining all the steps, the final query to get the number of exons for each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene would look like this:

```sql
SELECT t.attributes AS transcript_name, COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM features e
JOIN relations r ON e.id = r.child
JOIN features t ON r.parent = t.id
WHERE t.featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript') 
AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
AND t.id IN (
    SELECT f.id 
    FROM features f
    JOIN relations r ON f.id = r.child
    WHERE r.parent = (
        SELECT id 
        FROM features 
        WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
        AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'
    ) 
    AND f.featuretype IN ('mRNA', 'transcript')
)
GROUP BY t.id;
```

### Explanation of the Query
- The inner query retrieves the ID of the BRCA1 gene.
- The outer query counts the number of exons for each transcript isoform associated with the BRCA1 gene.
- The results will include the transcript isoform names and the corresponding number of exons.

### Execution
You can execute this SQL query in your SQLite database environment to get the desired results. Make sure to replace any placeholders with actual values as needed.
