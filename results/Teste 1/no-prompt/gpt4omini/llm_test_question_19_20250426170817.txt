To generate a boxplot comparing the sizes of `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcripts from the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Extract Transcript Sizes**: You need to query the `features` table to get the sizes of the transcripts for the specified feature types. The size of a transcript can be calculated as `end - start + 1`.

2. **Filter by Feature Types**: You will filter the results to include only the feature types `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA`.

3. **Prepare Data for Boxplot**: The results from the query should be structured in a way that can be easily used to create a boxplot.

4. **Create the Boxplot**: Use a plotting library (like Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python) to create the boxplot.

### Step 1: SQL Query to Extract Transcript Sizes

Here’s the SQL query to extract the sizes of the transcripts:

```sql
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA');
```

### Step 2: Execute the Query

You can execute the above SQL query using a SQLite connection in Python. Here’s an example of how to do that:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Execute the query and load the data into a DataFrame
query = """
SELECT 
    featuretype,
    (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM 
    features
WHERE 
    featuretype IN ('protein_coding', 'lncRNA', 'miRNA');
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Step 3: Create the Boxplot

Now that you have the data in a DataFrame, you can create the boxplot using Seaborn or Matplotlib:

```python
# Set the aesthetic style of the plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create the boxplot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='featuretype', y='size', data=df)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Comparison of Transcript Sizes for Different Feature Types')
plt.xlabel('Feature Type')
plt.ylabel('Transcript Size (bp)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Summary

1. You constructed an SQL query to extract the sizes of the transcripts for the specified feature types.
2. You executed the query and loaded the results into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. You created a boxplot using Seaborn to visualize the comparison of transcript sizes.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This process will give you a visual representation of the size distributions for `protein_coding`, `lncRNA`, and `miRNA` transcripts.
