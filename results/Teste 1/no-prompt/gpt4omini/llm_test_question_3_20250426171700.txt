To determine how many pseudogenes are present on the X chromosome using the provided SQLite database schema, you can execute a SQL query that counts the number of entries in the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'pseudogene' and the `seqid` is 'X'.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to construct and execute the query:

1. **Identify the relevant table and columns**: You need to focus on the `features` table, specifically the `featuretype` and `seqid` columns.

2. **Construct the SQL query**: You want to count the number of rows that match your criteria. The SQL query will look like this:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
   ```

3. **Execute the query**: You can run this query using a SQLite client or any programming language that supports SQLite (like Python, R, etc.). Here’s an example of how you might do it in Python:

   ```python
   import sqlite3

   # Connect to the SQLite database
   conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')  # Replace with your database file
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   # Execute the query
   cursor.execute("""
       SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
       FROM features
       WHERE featuretype = 'pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
   """)

   # Fetch the result
   result = cursor.fetchone()
   print(f"Number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome: {result[0]}")

   # Close the connection
   conn.close()
   ```

4. **Interpret the result**: The output will give you the count of pseudogenes located on the X chromosome.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file. This will provide you with the information you need regarding the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.
