To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has and to print the transcript isoform names along with their sizes, you can follow these steps using SQL queries on the SQLite database.

### Step 1: Identify the XIST Gene
First, you need to find the feature ID or attributes associated with the XIST gene. Typically, genes are represented in the `features` table with a `featuretype` of "gene".

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms
Once you have the gene ID for XIST, you can look for its associated transcript isoforms. Transcript isoforms are usually represented in the `features` table with a `featuretype` of "transcript".

### Step 3: Calculate Sizes
The size of each transcript can be calculated as the difference between the `end` and `start` positions.

### SQL Queries
Here’s how you can structure your SQL queries:

1. **Find the Gene ID for XIST**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id 
   FROM features 
   WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%';
   ```

2. **Find Transcript Isoforms for the XIST Gene**:
   Assuming the gene ID you found is `xist_gene_id`, you can find the transcript isoforms:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, start, end 
   FROM features 
   WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%' AND id IN (
       SELECT child 
       FROM relations 
       WHERE parent = 'xist_gene_id'
   );
   ```

3. **Calculate Sizes and Print Transcript Names**:
   You can combine the above queries to get the transcript names and their sizes:
   ```sql
   SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start) AS size 
   FROM features 
   WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id IN (
       SELECT child 
       FROM relations 
       WHERE parent = (
           SELECT id 
           FROM features 
           WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%'
       )
   );
   ```

### Final Query
Here’s the complete query that you can run to get the desired output:
```sql
SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start) AS size 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id IN (
    SELECT child 
    FROM relations 
    WHERE parent = (
        SELECT id 
        FROM features 
        WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%'
    )
);
```

### Execution
Run the final query in your SQLite environment. This will return the transcript isoform names and their sizes for the XIST gene. 

### Note
- Ensure that the `seqid` for the XIST gene is correctly specified (in this case, 'X' is assumed).
- The `attributes` field may vary in format, so adjust the `LIKE` clause as necessary to match the actual format in your database.
