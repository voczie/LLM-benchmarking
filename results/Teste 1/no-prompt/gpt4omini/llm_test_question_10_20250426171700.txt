To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene from the provided SQLite database schema, you will need to query the `features` table, as it contains the relevant information about genomic features, including genes.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant table**: The `features` table contains information about genes, including their positions (start and end) on the chromosome.

2. **Determine the attributes to filter**: You want to find the entry for the BRCA1 gene. The `attributes` column typically contains additional information about the feature, including the gene name.

3. **Construct the SQL query**: You will need to select the `seqid`, `start`, and `end` columns from the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'gene' (or whatever type is appropriate for genes in your dataset) and the `attributes` contain 'BRCA1'.

Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT seqid, start, end`: This part of the query specifies that you want to retrieve the chromosome identifier (`seqid`), the start position (`start`), and the end position (`end`) of the gene.
- `FROM features`: This indicates that you are querying the `features` table.
- `WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`: This condition filters the results to only include entries that are classified as genes.
- `AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'`: This condition further filters the results to include only those entries where the `attributes` column contains the string 'BRCA1'.

### Executing the Query:
You can execute this SQL query using a SQLite client or any programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). 

### Example in Python:
If you are using Python, here’s a simple example of how you might execute this query:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT seqid, start, end
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(f"Chromosome: {row[0]}, Start: {row[1]}, End: {row[2]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Conclusion:
This will give you the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene, including the chromosome it is located on and its start and end positions. Make sure to adjust the database connection string and any other parameters as necessary for your specific setup.
