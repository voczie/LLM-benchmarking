To answer the question of how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using the provided SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Feature Types**: In GFF/GTF files, genes and transcripts are typically represented by specific feature types. Common feature types include:
   - `gene` for genes
   - `mRNA` or `transcript` for transcripts

2. **Construct SQL Queries**: You will need to write SQL queries to count the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3.

### SQL Queries

1. **Count Genes on Chromosome 3**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS gene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene';
   ```

2. **Count Transcripts on Chromosome 3**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS transcript_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND (featuretype = 'mRNA' OR featuretype = 'transcript');
   ```

### Combined Query

If you want to get both counts in a single query, you can use a `UNION ALL` approach or a `CASE` statement. Here’s an example using `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT 'gene' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'transcript' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND (featuretype = 'mRNA' OR featuretype = 'transcript');
```

### Execution

To execute these queries, you would typically use a SQLite client or a programming language with SQLite support (like Python with the `sqlite3` module). Here’s a brief example in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the combined query
query = """
SELECT 'gene' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND featuretype = 'gene'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'transcript' AS feature_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = 'chr3' AND (featuretype = 'mRNA' OR featuretype = 'transcript');
"""

cursor.execute(query)
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the results
for feature_type, count in results:
    print(f"{feature_type}: {count}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Summary

- You will count the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 by querying the `features` table based on the `seqid` and `featuretype`.
- You can execute the queries directly in a SQLite environment or through a programming language that supports SQLite.
