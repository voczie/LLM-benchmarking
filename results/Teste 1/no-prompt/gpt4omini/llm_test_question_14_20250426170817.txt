To find out the strand information for the HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12 genes from the SQLite database with the provided schema, you can use a SQL query to retrieve the relevant data from the `features` table. The `features` table contains the necessary information about the genes, including their strand.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to construct the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: You need the `featuretype`, `strand`, and `attributes` columns from the `features` table. The `attributes` column typically contains gene names and other metadata.

2. **Construct the SQL query**: You will want to filter the results to include only the rows where the gene names match HOTAIR, HOXC11, and HOXC12. The gene names are usually found in the `attributes` column, so you will need to use a `LIKE` clause or a specific parsing method depending on how the attributes are formatted.

3. **Execute the query**: Run the query against your SQLite database to get the results.

Here’s an example SQL query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes
FROM features
WHERE (attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%')
AND featuretype = 'gene';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes`: This selects the sequence ID, feature type, strand, and attributes for the genes.
- `FROM features`: This specifies that we are querying the `features` table.
- `WHERE (attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%')`: This filters the results to include only those rows where the `attributes` column contains the names of the genes we are interested in.
- `AND featuretype = 'gene'`: This ensures that we are only looking at rows that represent genes.

### Running the Query:
You can run this query using a SQLite client or through a programming language that supports SQLite (like Python with the `sqlite3` module).

### Example in Python:
If you are using Python, here’s how you might execute the query:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT seqid, featuretype, strand, attributes
FROM features
WHERE (attributes LIKE '%HOTAIR%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC11%' OR attributes LIKE '%HOXC12%')
AND featuretype = 'gene';
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch and print the results
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Output:
The output will show the sequence ID, feature type, strand, and attributes for each of the specified genes, allowing you to determine the strand they are located on.
