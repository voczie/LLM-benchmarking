To determine how many miRNA genes exist on chromosome 10 using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a SQL query that filters and counts relevant entries from the `features` table. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Schema

- **features**: This table contains genomic features with attributes such as `seqid` (chromosome identifier), `featuretype`, and others.
- **relations**: This table might be useful if you need to explore hierarchical relationships between features, but for counting miRNA genes directly, it may not be necessary unless there are specific parent-child relationships to consider.

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Columns

For your query:
- **seqid**: Should match "10" for chromosome 10.
- **featuretype**: Should include entries that represent miRNA. Commonly, miRNAs might be annotated as `miRNA` or similar terms depending on the annotation source.

### Step 3: Construct the SQL Query

You will need to:
1. Filter by `seqid = '10'`.
2. Identify rows where `featuretype` indicates a miRNA.
3. Count these entries.

Here's how you can construct the query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS miRNA_count
FROM features
WHERE seqid = '10'
  AND featuretype LIKE '%miRNA%';
```

### Explanation of the Query

- **COUNT(*)**: This function counts all rows that match the criteria.
- **seqid = '10'**: Filters entries to only those on chromosome 10.
- **featuretype LIKE '%miRNA%'**: Uses a wildcard search to find any `featuretype` containing "miRNA". Adjust this pattern if your database uses different terminology for miRNAs.

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run this query in your SQLite environment. It will return the number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.

### Additional Considerations

- **Attributes Column**: If `featuretype` does not directly contain "miRNA", you might need to inspect the `attributes` column for more detailed information.
- **Database Specifics**: Ensure that the terminology used in your database matches what is expected in the query. Adjust the `LIKE` pattern if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine how many miRNA genes are present on chromosome 10 in your dataset.
