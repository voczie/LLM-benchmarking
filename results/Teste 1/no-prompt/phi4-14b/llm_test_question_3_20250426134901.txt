To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using your SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema**: 
   - The `features` table contains genomic features with attributes such as `seqid`, `featuretype`, and others.
   - For this query, we are interested in:
     - `seqid`: This represents the chromosome or scaffold name (e.g., "X" for the X chromosome).
     - `featuretype`: This indicates the type of feature (e.g., "pseudogene").

2. **Formulate the Query**:
   - You need to count entries in the `features` table where `seqid` is "X" and `featuretype` is "pseudogene".

3. **Write the SQL Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count
   FROM features
   WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene';
   ```

4. **Execute the Query**:
   - Use an SQLite client or a programming language with SQLite support (e.g., Python, R) to execute this query against your database.

### Explanation

- `SELECT COUNT(*) AS pseudogene_count`: This part of the query counts all rows that match the specified conditions and labels the result as `pseudogene_count`.
- `FROM features`: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.
- `WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene'`: Filters the rows to include only those where the chromosome is "X" and the feature type is "pseudogene".

### Additional Considerations

- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure that the values for `seqid` and `featuretype` match exactly with how they are stored in your database. If there's any inconsistency, you might need to adjust the query (e.g., using `LOWER()` function).
- **Data Integrity**: Verify that the data is correctly populated in the `features` table, especially the `seqid` and `featuretype` columns.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine how many pseudogenes are present on the X chromosome in your dataset.
