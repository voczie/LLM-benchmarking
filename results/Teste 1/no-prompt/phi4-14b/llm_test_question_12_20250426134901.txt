To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions of the gene `COL1A2` in the genome annotation data stored in your SQLite database. Then, we will find the genes that are immediately before and after it based on their start positions.

Here's a step-by-step guide with SQL queries to achieve this:

### Step 1: Identify the Position of `COL1A2`

First, we need to find the start position of the gene `COL1A2`. We'll assume that the gene name is stored in the `attributes` column in a format like `gene_name="COL1A2"`.

```sql
SELECT id, seqid, start, end, strand
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%';
```

This query will return the ID and positional information of the gene `COL1A2`.

### Step 2: Find the Gene Immediately Before `COL1A2`

To find the gene immediately before `COL1A2`, we need to look for a gene on the same chromosome (`seqid`) with an end position just before the start position of `COL1A2`. We also need to consider the strand orientation.

```sql
WITH col1a2 AS (
    SELECT id, seqid, start, end, strand
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
)
SELECT f.id, f.attributes
FROM features f, col1a2 c
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.seqid = c.seqid
  AND (
      (f.end < c.start AND c.strand = '+') OR
      (f.start > c.end AND c.strand = '-')
    )
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN c.strand = '+' THEN f.end ELSE f.start END DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Find the Gene Immediately After `COL1A2`

Similarly, to find the gene immediately after `COL1A2`, we look for a gene on the same chromosome with a start position just after the end position of `COL1A2`.

```sql
WITH col1a2 AS (
    SELECT id, seqid, start, end, strand
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name="COL1A2"%'
)
SELECT f.id, f.attributes
FROM features f, col1a2 c
WHERE f.featuretype = 'gene'
  AND f.seqid = c.seqid
  AND (
      (f.start > c.end AND c.strand = '+') OR
      (f.end < c.start AND c.strand = '-')
    )
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN c.strand = '+' THEN f.start ELSE f.end END ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 4: Extract Gene Names

The above queries return the `id` and `attributes` of the genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`. To extract the gene names, you can use SQLite's string functions to parse the `attributes` column.

For example, if the attributes are stored as `gene_name="GENE_NAME";`, you can extract the name using:

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'gene_name=') + 10, INSTR(attributes, '"', INSTR(attributes, 'gene_name="') + 1) - (INSTR(attributes, 'gene_name=') + 10)) AS gene_name
FROM (
    -- Use the query from Step 2 or Step 3 here to get the attributes of the genes before and after COL1A2
);
```

Replace the inner query with either the query from Step 2 or Step 3 to extract the names of the genes immediately before and after `COL1A2`.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the gene names located immediately before and after `COL1A2`.
