To determine on which chromosomes the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB are located using your SQLite database schema, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understand the Schema**: 
   - The `features` table contains genomic features with attributes such as `seqid` (chromosome), `featuretype`, and gene names stored in the `attributes` column.
   - We need to extract information from the `attributes` column, which typically includes key-value pairs like `gene_name="NFKB1"`.

2. **Extract Gene Information**:
   - Use SQL queries to filter rows where the `featuretype` is "gene" and the `attributes` contain any of the gene names: NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, or RELB.
   - The `attributes` column needs parsing because it's a text field containing key-value pairs.

3. **Write SQL Queries**:
   - Use SQLite's string functions to parse and filter based on the `attributes` column.

Here is an example query to find the chromosomes for each gene:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT seqid 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND (
    attributes LIKE '%gene_name="NFKB1"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="NFKB2"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="REL"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="RELA"%'
    OR attributes LIKE '%gene_name="RELB"%'
);
```

### Explanation

- **`SELECT DISTINCT seqid`**: This selects unique chromosome identifiers where the genes are located.
- **`FROM features`**: Specifies the table containing genomic feature data.
- **`WHERE featuretype = 'gene'`**: Filters rows to include only those with a `featuretype` of "gene".
- **`AND (...)`**: Ensures that only rows with attributes matching any of the specified gene names are selected.
- **`LIKE '%gene_name="GENE_NAME"%'"`**: Searches for the specific gene name within the `attributes` column. The `%` wildcard allows for other text before or after the key-value pair.

### Running the Query

1. Open your SQLite database using a tool like `sqlite3`, DBeaver, or any SQL client that supports SQLite.
2. Execute the query provided above.
3. Review the results to see which chromosomes contain each of the specified genes.

This approach will give you a list of distinct chromosome identifiers for the genes NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB.
