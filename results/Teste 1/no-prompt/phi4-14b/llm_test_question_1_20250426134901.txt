To determine how many protein-coding genes are located on chromosome 12 using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a SQL query that filters and counts entries in the `features` table. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Schema

- **features Table**: This table contains information about genomic features such as genes.
  - `seqid`: Represents the chromosome or scaffold ID.
  - `featuretype`: Describes the type of feature (e.g., gene, mRNA).
  - `attributes`: Contains additional details in a key-value format.

### Step 2: Identify Protein-Coding Genes

Protein-coding genes are typically represented by specific feature types such as "gene" or "mRNA". Additionally, within the `attributes` column, you might find information indicating that a gene is protein-coding. This often includes tags like `gene_type="protein_coding"`.

### Step 3: Construct the SQL Query

You need to filter for entries where:
- The `seqid` corresponds to chromosome 12.
- The `featuretype` indicates a gene or mRNA.
- The `attributes` column contains information indicating that the feature is protein-coding.

Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT f.id) AS protein_coding_genes_count
FROM features f
WHERE f.seqid = '12'  -- Assuming '12' is the identifier for chromosome 12
AND (
    (f.featuretype = 'gene' AND f.attributes LIKE '%gene_type="protein_coding"%') OR
    (f.featuretype = 'mRNA' AND f.attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype="protein_coding"%')
);
```

### Explanation of the Query

- **`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT f.id)`**: Counts unique gene IDs to ensure each gene is counted only once.
- **`WHERE f.seqid = '12'`**: Filters for features on chromosome 12.
- **Feature Type and Attributes**:
  - Checks if `featuretype` is "gene" and the `attributes` column contains `gene_type="protein_coding"`.
  - Alternatively, checks if `featuretype` is "mRNA" and the `attributes` column contains `gene_biotype="protein_coding"`.

### Step 4: Execute the Query

Run this query in your SQLite environment to get the count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12. Adjust the attribute conditions based on how your data specifically marks protein-coding genes, as these can vary slightly between datasets.

This approach should give you an accurate count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using your database schema.
