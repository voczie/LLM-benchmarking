To determine how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, you can follow these steps using SQL queries on your SQLite database. Here's a walkthrough:

### Step 1: Identify the BRCA1 Gene

First, we need to identify the IDs of all features related to the BRCA1 gene. This typically involves searching for the gene name in the `attributes` column.

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%';
```

This query will return the IDs of features that are associated with the BRCA1 gene.

### Step 2: Find Transcript Isoforms Related to BRCA1

Next, we need to find all transcript isoforms related to these BRCA1 gene IDs. This involves using the `relations` table to link genes to their transcripts.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%'
) AND level = 2;
```

This query retrieves all transcript isoform IDs that are children of the BRCA1 gene entries, assuming `level = 2` indicates a gene-to-transcript relationship.

### Step 3: Retrieve Exon Counts for Each Transcript Isoform

Now, we need to count the number of exons associated with each transcript isoform. This involves linking transcripts to their exons using the `relations` table again and counting the exon features.

```sql
SELECT 
    t.child AS transcript_id,
    f.attributes,
    COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM relations r1
JOIN relations r2 ON r1.child = r2.parent AND r2.level = 3
JOIN features f ON r1.child = f.id
LEFT JOIN features e ON r2.child = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
WHERE r1.parent IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%'
) 
AND r1.level = 2
GROUP BY t.child, f.attributes;
```

### Step 4: Extract Transcript Names

Finally, extract the transcript names from the `attributes` column. This typically involves parsing the `transcript_name` attribute.

```sql
SELECT 
    SUBSTR(attributes, INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_id "') + 15, INSTR(attributes, '"', INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_id "') + 15) - (INSTR(attributes, 'transcript_id "') + 15)) AS transcript_name,
    COUNT(e.id) AS exon_count
FROM relations r1
JOIN relations r2 ON r1.child = r2.parent AND r2.level = 3
JOIN features f ON r1.child = f.id
LEFT JOIN features e ON r2.child = e.id AND e.featuretype = 'exon'
WHERE r1.parent IN (
    SELECT id FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id "BRCA1"%'
) 
AND r1.level = 2
GROUP BY transcript_name;
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Identifies the BRCA1 gene entries.
- **Step 2**: Finds all transcripts related to these genes.
- **Step 3**: Counts exons for each transcript by linking them through the `relations` table.
- **Step 4**: Extracts and prints the transcript names along with their exon counts.

This approach assumes that the `attributes` column contains key-value pairs in a specific format, which is common in GFF/GTF files. Adjustments may be needed based on the exact format of your data.
