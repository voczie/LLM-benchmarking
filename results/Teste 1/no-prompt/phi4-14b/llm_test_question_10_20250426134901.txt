To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using your SQLite database, you'll need to perform a series of steps. The goal is to query the `features` table for entries related to the BRCA1 gene and extract its start and end positions on the chromosome.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Identify the BRCA1 Gene

The BRCA1 gene will be identified by its attributes in the GFF/GTF format. Typically, this information is stored in the `attributes` column of the `features` table. The `attributes` field often contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons and spaces.

### Step 2: Query the Database

You need to write a SQL query that searches for entries where the `featuretype` is "gene" (or another relevant type if your data uses different conventions) and the `attributes` contain information about BRCA1. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT seqid, start, end
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%';
```

### Explanation of the Query

- **`featuretype = 'gene'`:** This filters the entries to only include those that are genes. Depending on your data, you might need to adjust this if BRCA1 is annotated differently.
  
- **`attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'`:** This part searches for any gene whose attributes mention "BRCA1". The `%` symbols are wildcards in SQL, meaning they match any sequence of characters before or after "BRCA1".

### Step 3: Execute the Query

Run this query in your SQLite environment. It will return rows containing the `seqid`, `start`, and `end` columns for entries matching the criteria.

- **`seqid`:** This is typically the chromosome name (e.g., "chr17").
  
- **`start` and `end`:** These are the chromosomal positions where the BRCA1 gene starts and ends, respectively.

### Step 4: Interpret the Results

The result of your query will give you the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene. For example:

```
seqid | start | end
-------------------
chr17 | 43044295 | 43125482
```

This indicates that the BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17, starting at position 43,044,295 and ending at position 43,125,482.

### Additional Considerations

- **Attributes Parsing:** If your `attributes` field uses a different format (e.g., key-value pairs with "="), you might need to adjust the query to parse it correctly. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT seqid, start, end
  FROM features
  WHERE featuretype = 'gene'
  AND attributes LIKE '%ID=BRCA1%';
  ```

- **Database Schema:** Ensure that your database schema matches what is expected in the query. Adjust field names if necessary.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene from your SQLite database.
