To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using your SQLite database, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the XIST Gene

First, we need to identify the ID of the XIST gene. This information is typically stored in the `attributes` column of the `features` table. The attributes are usually formatted as key-value pairs separated by semicolons.

#### Query to Find the XIST Gene ID:

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%ID=XIST%';
```

This query searches for a gene with an attribute indicating it is the XIST gene. The `%` symbols are wildcards that allow for any characters before or after `ID=XIST`.

### Step 2: Find Exons Related to the XIST Gene

Once you have the ID of the XIST gene, use it to find all related exons. This involves using the `relations` table to find features (exons) that are children of the XIST gene.

#### Query to Find Exon IDs:

Assuming the result from Step 1 gives us a gene ID (let's call it `XIST_gene_id`), use this ID in the following query:

```sql
SELECT child 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_gene_id' AND level = 1;
```

Here, `level = 1` typically indicates direct children of the gene, which should be exons.

### Step 3: Count the Exons

Finally, count the number of unique exon entries retrieved in Step 2.

#### Query to Count Exons:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT child) AS exon_count 
FROM relations 
WHERE parent = 'XIST_gene_id' AND level = 1;
```

### Complete Walkthrough

1. **Run the first query** to get the ID of the XIST gene.
2. **Use the retrieved gene ID** in the second query to find all related exons.
3. **Count the number of unique exon IDs** using the third query.

By following these steps, you will determine how many exons are associated with the XIST gene in your database. Make sure to replace `'XIST_gene_id'` with the actual ID obtained from Step 1 when running the queries.
