Okay, so I need to help generate a SQL query that can be used in SQLite to create a boxplot comparing the sizes of protein-coding, lncRNA, and miRNA transcripts. Hmm, but wait, boxplots are usually visualizations done with tools like R or Python libraries such as matplotlib. However, since the user is asking for a SQL query, maybe they want to get the data that can be used for such a visualization.

First, I should figure out what fields in the database contain information about the transcript types and their sizes. Looking at the schema provided, there's an 'attributes' field which is usually where annotation info is stored. So perhaps each attribute is something like "transcript_type='protein_coding'" or similar for lncRNA and miRNA.

So I need to extract the size of each transcript (probably from the 'end - start' in the genome coordinates) along with its type. The types are protein_coding, lncRNA, and miRNA. 

I think the steps would be:

1. Extract the end and start positions from the features table for each transcript.
2. Calculate the size as end - start + 1 (since it's inclusive).
3. Determine the type of each transcript by parsing the 'attributes' field to find the specific annotation.

But wait, how are these types stored in the attributes? For example, is it something like "transcript_type='miRNA'" or maybe using a colon-separated list with possible multiple values?

Assuming that the 'attributes' can be parsed to extract the transcript type. So I'll need a regular expression to find all key=value pairs and pick out the one where the key is 'transcript_type'.

So, in SQL, for each row in the features table, if it's an exon or other feature (since transcripts are made of exons), we can get their start and end positions.

Wait, but the user mentioned protein_coding, lncRNA, and miRNA. So perhaps these are different transcript types stored as separate entries in the 'features' table with their respective annotations.

So I need to write a query that selects from the features table where the feature type is one of those three, extract their size, and group them by type.

But how do I get the correct start and end for each transcript? Because transcripts are made up of exons. So maybe we should look into the 'exons' table if it exists. Wait, but in the schema provided, there's a features table but no exons table. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'features' table includes all types of genomic elements, including transcripts (which are made up of exons). So each transcript is represented as an entry in the features table with type='transcript', and then their start and end positions would be where they begin and end on the genome.

Wait, but if that's the case, maybe I can get all transcripts by selecting from 'features' where featuretype='transcript'. Then for each of those, extract the size as end - start + 1. But how do I know which type (protein_coding, lncRNA, miRNA) it is?

Ah, right, that's where the attributes come in. So perhaps within the 'attributes' field, there will be an entry like transcript_type='miRNA'. So for each row, we can parse this attribute to get the type.

So putting it all together:

1. From the features table, select rows where featuretype is 'transcript'.
2. For each of these, extract start and end positions.
3. Calculate size as (end - start + 1).
4. Parse the attributes field to find the transcript_type.
5. Group by transcript_type and aggregate the sizes.

But wait, in SQLite, how do I parse the attributes? Because 'attributes' is a text field that contains key=value pairs separated by semicolons or commas, possibly with spaces. So perhaps using a regular expression to extract all key=value pairs.

So maybe something like:

SELECT id, start, end, (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP extract('transcript_type', attributes) as type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript';

But I'm not sure if that's the best way. Alternatively, perhaps using a subquery to extract all transcript types.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use a regular expression to find all key=value pairs in the attributes field and then select only those where key is 'transcript_type'.

So something like:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       ( gsub( ~;~ , attributes ) as attr_list
          SELECT substr(attr_list, 4, 255) as key, value
          FROM (
              SELECT attr_list
              FROM features
              WHERE id = ?
              AND featuretype = 'transcript'
              )
          WHERE substr(attr_list, 9, 100) LIKE '%=transcript_type%'
          ) AS transcript_type
FROM features;

Wait, that might be too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a regex to extract the transcript_type directly.

So maybe:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP '(.*?)=transcript_type=(.*)' , attributes ) AS type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript';

But I'm not sure if that works correctly. Alternatively, perhaps using a regex to extract all possible key=value pairs and then select only the ones where key is transcript_type.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use a subquery to get all attributes for each row and parse them.

Wait, but in SQLite, you can't directly execute multiple queries within a SELECT unless you use Common Table Expressions (CTEs). So perhaps:

WITH attr AS (
    SELECT id, start, end,
           REGEXP '(.*?)(=|;)(.*?)' , attributes ) as key_val
    FROM features
    WHERE featuretype = 'transcript'
)
SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP '(.*?)=transcript_type=(.*)' , key_val ) AS type
FROM attr
WHERE key_val LIKE '%=transcript_type%';

Hmm, that might work. So first, extract all the attribute key-value pairs into a table called 'attr', then in the outer query, look for the one where key is transcript_type.

But I'm not sure if this will correctly capture all possible attributes or just the ones we're interested in. Also, perhaps using semicolons as separators instead of commas might be better since some attributes could have spaces around them.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to use a regex that captures the entire 'transcript_type' attribute and ignores others.

Wait, but if each transcript has only one relevant attribute (like transcript_type), then this approach should work. So perhaps:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP '(.*?)=transcript_type=(.*)' , attributes ) AS type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript';

But I'm not sure if the regex will correctly extract it. Maybe using a more precise pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps just use:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP '(.*?)=transcript_type=(.*)' , attributes ) AS type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript';

But I'm not sure if that will correctly extract the value. Maybe it's better to use a subquery.

Alternatively, perhaps using:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       (SELECT substr(attr, 9, 255) FROM (SELECT attr FROM features WHERE id = ? AND featuretype='transcript' AND (SELECT substr(attr,4,255) LIKE '%=transcript_type%')) ) AS type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype='transcript';

But that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the 'attributes' field contains all possible annotations for each feature. So maybe using:

SELECT id, start, end,
       (end - start + 1) as size,
       REGEXP '(.*?)=transcript_type=(.*)' , attributes ) AS type
FROM features
WHERE featuretype='transcript';
