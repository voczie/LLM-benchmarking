Okay, so I need to figure out how to find the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using an SQLite database that contains GFF/GTF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that GFF files store genomic features like exons, genes, etc., along with their attributes. In the provided schema, there's a table called 'features' which includes fields like id, seqid, source, featuretype, start, end, score, strand, frame, attributes, extra, and bin.

The user is asking about BRCA1 isoforms, so I need to look for entries where the feature type is 'exon'. That means I'll query the features table where featuretype = 'exon' and id starts with 'BRCA1'. Wait, but in GFF files, each transcript can have multiple exons, right? So BRCA1 might be represented as a single transcript (id like 'BRCA1.2') containing multiple exons.

So the first query should select all exons where the id starts with 'BRCA1' and featuretype is exon. That would give me each exon's start and end positions, which I can use to calculate their lengths.

Once I have all the exons for BRCA1, I need to compute the average size. For each exon, the length is end - start + 1 (since both ends are inclusive). Then sum all these lengths and divide by the number of exons.

I should also consider if there's a possibility that some exons might be duplicates or have issues with their attributes. Maybe I can use an ORDER BY clause to ensure they're in order, but since GFF files usually list them correctly, it might not be necessary.

Wait, do I need to handle any potential issues like overlapping exons? In GFF/GTF, exons shouldn't overlap if properly annotated, so that should be fine. Also, the 'id' field for exons is unique per feature, but since we're selecting based on BRCA1, it's okay.

Putting this together, I'll write a SELECT statement to get all exon features with id starting with 'BRCA1'. Then calculate each exon length and average them.

To determine the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using an SQLite database containing GFF/GTF data, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Exons for BRCA1 Isoforms
First, query the `features` table to retrieve all exons associated with the BRCA1 transcript. This involves selecting entries where the feature type is 'exon' and the id starts with 'BRCA1'.

```sql
SELECT id, start, end FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND id LIKE 'BRCA1%';
```

### Step 2: Calculate Exon Lengths
For each exon retrieved, calculate its length by subtracting the start position from the end position and adding one (to account for inclusive indexing).

```sql
SELECT (end - start + 1) AS length FROM (
    SELECT id, start, end FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND id LIKE 'BRCA1%'
) AS exons;
```

### Step 3: Compute the Average Exon Size
Aggregate the lengths of all BRCA1 exons and divide by the number of exons to find the average size.

```sql
SELECT AVG(end - start + 1) AS average_length FROM (
    SELECT id, start, end FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND id LIKE 'BRCA1%'
) AS exons;
```

### Explanation
- **Step 1** retrieves all exon records for BRCA1 isoforms.
- **Step 2** calculates the length of each exon using basic arithmetic operations on the start and end positions.
- **Step 3** computes the average of these lengths, providing the desired metric.

This approach efficiently leverages SQL's aggregation capabilities to derive the average exon size from the genomic data stored in the database.
