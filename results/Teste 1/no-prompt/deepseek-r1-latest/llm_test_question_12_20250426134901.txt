Okay, so I need to figure out how to print the names of the two genes right before and after COL1A2 in a GFF/GTF database using SQLite. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that the data is stored in an SQLite database with specific tables: features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. The main table here is 'features' because it contains all the genomic information like genes, their start and end positions, etc.

The user wants to find the immediate neighbors of COL1A2. So, I need to identify where COL1A2 is located in the features table. Each gene has a 'start' and 'end' position, right? The gene before it would be the one with an 'end' just before COL1A2's start, and the next gene would have a 'start' immediately after COL1A2's end.

I should probably use a SELECT statement to get the start and end of COL1A2 first. Once I have those values, say COL1A2 starts at position 500 and ends at 600, then I need to query for genes where 'start' is 601 or 'end' is 499.

But wait, how do I handle this in SQL? Maybe using a subquery to get the start and end of COL1A2. Then use those values in another SELECT statement with conditions on start > end_of_COL1A2 -1 or start < start_of_COL1A2 +1.

I also need to make sure that the table is correctly referenced as 'features' without any aliases, so I'll have to write the SQL query accordingly.

Putting it all together, first get COL1A2's details, then find genes with start just after end or end just before start. Finally, extract their names and print them.

To find the immediate neighboring genes of COL1A2 in your SQLite database, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify COL1A2's Position
First, determine the start and end positions of COL1A2.

```sql
SELECT start as col_start, end as col_end FROM features WHERE id = 'COL1A2';
```

This will give you `col_start` and `col_end`, which are essential for finding neighboring genes.

### Step 2: Find Immediate Neighbors

#### Gene Before COL1A2:
Find the gene that ends just before COL1A2 starts.

```sql
SELECT name FROM features WHERE end = col_start - 1;
```

#### Gene After COL1A2:
Find the gene that starts immediately after COL1A2 ends.

```sql
SELECT name FROM features WHERE start = col_end + 1;
```

### Step 3: Combine Queries

To get both neighbors in one query, use parameters to avoid typing them twice:

```sql
-- Save the positions as parameters
CREATE TABLE temp (id text);
INSERT INTO temp VALUES ('COL1A2');
SELECT start as col_start, end as col_end FROM temp WHERE id = 'COL1A2';

-- Find neighboring genes
SELECT 
    (SELECT name FROM features WHERE end = col_start - 1) AS prev_gene,
    (SELECT name FROM features WHERE start = col_end + 1) AS next_gene
FROM temp;
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1** locates COL1A2's exact position in the genome.
- **Steps 2a and 2b** query for genes that are immediately adjacent to COL1A2, ensuring you get both predecessors and successors.

This approach efficiently retrieves the required information using SQL queries tailored to your database structure.
