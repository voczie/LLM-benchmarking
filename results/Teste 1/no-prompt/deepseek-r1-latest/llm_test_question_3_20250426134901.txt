Alright, so I need to figure out how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome using the provided database schema and GFF/GTF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that pseudogenes are non-coding RNA transcripts that are derived from gene pseudovariants. They usually have similar sequences to their corresponding genes but lack functional protein products. In a GFF file, pseudogenes are typically represented with the featuretype 'gene_pseudogene'.

Next, looking at the database schema, I see there's a table called 'features' which includes an 'id', 'seqid', and other attributes like 'source', 'featuretype', etc. The 'seqid' probably refers to the chromosome or sequence identifier. So, for X chromosomes, the 'seqid' would likely be something like 'chrX'.

I need to write a SQL query that selects all records from the 'features' table where 'featuretype' is 'gene_pseudogene' and 'seqid' is 'chrX'. Then, I can count how many such entries there are.

Wait, but what if the GTF/GFF file doesn't have any pseudogenes on chrX? The query should still return zero in that case. Also, I need to make sure that the 'seqid' for X chromosome is correctly identified as 'chrX'. If it's something else, like 'X', maybe I should adjust accordingly.

I think using a raw SQL command would be appropriate here since it allows me to directly query the database without relying on higher-level abstractions. So, I'll write a SELECT statement that counts the number of pseudogenes in the X chromosome.

Let me structure the query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene' AND seqid LIKE 'chrX%'; Wait, no, that's not correct because 'seqid' for chrX might just be 'chrX', so using LIKE would require a wildcard. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a string match with 'chrX' as part of the id.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the seqid starts with 'chrX'. So, using LIKE 'chrX%'. But that depends on how the GTF/GFF file represents the chromosome. If chrX is just 'X', then maybe it's better to use a case-insensitive comparison or an exact match.

Wait, in many cases, the seqid for chromosomes starts with 'chr' followed by the chromosome number or name. So, if X is represented as 'chrX', then using LIKE 'chrX%' would work. But I'm not sure if that's always the case. Maybe it's better to use a string match without the prefix.

Alternatively, perhaps the seqid for chrX is just 'X'. In that case, the query should be WHERE seqid = 'X' and featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene'.

But since I don't have access to the actual data, I can only go by the schema. So, assuming that the X chromosome's sequence identifier is 'chrX', then using LIKE would make sense.

Wait, no, if the seqid for chrX is just 'X', then using LIKE 'X%' might not be accurate because other features on chrX could have ids like 'X_12345'. So, perhaps it's better to use an exact match. But I'm not sure how the data is structured.

Alternatively, maybe the seqid for X chromosome is stored as 'chrX', so using LIKE 'chrX%' would capture all entries on chrX. That seems more accurate because other chromosomes might have seqids like 'chr1', 'chr2', etc., and X would be 'chrX'.

So, putting it all together, the SQL query would count the number of rows where featuretype is 'gene_pseudogene' and seqid starts with 'chrX'. 

Wait, but in the schema, 'seqid' is a text type. So, using LIKE might not work as expected because it's case-sensitive. Maybe I should use a string comparison that's case-insensitive or exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the GTF/GFF file uses an identifier like 'X' for chrX, so using WHERE seqid = 'X' would be better.

I think to cover all possibilities, I'll write two queries: one with LIKE and another with an exact match. But since the user asked for a single query, maybe it's safer to use the exact match if possible.

Wait, but without knowing how the data is structured, perhaps using a substring approach is more reliable. So, checking if 'chrX' is part of the seqid would ensure that we're capturing all X chromosome entries regardless of their specific identifier format.

So, the final query would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene' AND seqid LIKE 'chrX%';

But I'm not entirely sure if this will work correctly because it depends on how the data is stored. Alternatively, maybe using a case-insensitive comparison or an exact match.

Wait, another approach could be to use a regular expression with a case-insensitive flag, but that might complicate things. Maybe sticking with an exact match is better for now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if 'X' is part of the seqid without worrying about the prefix. So, using WHERE seqid LIKE '%X%' would capture any id where 'X' appears in the middle or end.

But that might include other chromosomes as well if they have X in their ids, which isn't likely because most chromosomes are numbered or named with letters like chr1, chr2, etc., and X is a separate chromosome.

Hmm, I think using an exact match for 'X' would be more precise. So, the query would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';

But wait, in some GTF/GFF files, the chrX might have a different id format. For example, maybe it's stored as 'chrX' or just 'X'. I need to be cautious about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substring approach is better because if X chromosome has multiple features with ids like 'X_12345', then using LIKE 'X%' would capture all of them. But in reality, most GTF/GFF files use the seqid as the chromosome name without any suffix, so maybe it's just 'X'.

In that case, an exact match is better.

So, to sum up, I'll write a SQL query that counts the number of gene_pseudogene entries where seqid is exactly 'X'. That should give me the count of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

To determine how many pseudogenes are located on the X chromosome using the provided database schema and GFF/GTF data, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Data Structure**: The `features` table contains information about genomic features, including their type (e.g., gene_pseudogene) and sequence identifier (`seqid`). For the X chromosome, the `seqid` is likely 'X'.

2. **Formulate the Query**: Use a SQL query to count all records where the feature type is 'gene_pseudogene' and the sequence identifier is exactly 'X'. This will give you the number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

3. **Execute the Query**: Run the following SQL command in your database:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene_pseudogene' AND seqid = 'X';
```

4. **Interpret the Results**: The result will be the number of pseudogenes found on the X chromosome.

This approach efficiently queries the database to provide the required count based on the given schema and data structure.
