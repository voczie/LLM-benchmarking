Okay, so I need to figure out how many exons the XIST gene has using the provided database schema and SQL. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that XIST is a non-coding RNA gene involved in X-chromosome inactivation. But wait, actually, it's a gene located on chromosome 17, right? So maybe I should start by finding where XIST is located in the genome.

Looking at the database schema, there are tables like features and relations. Features probably contain all the genomic annotations, including genes, exons, etc. Each feature has an id, seqid (which might be the chromosome), source (which would be 'gene' for a gene), featuretype ('exon', 'gene'), start and end positions.

So I need to query the features table where featuretype is 'exon' and seqid is the chromosome where XIST is located. But wait, how do I find out which chromosome XIST is on? Maybe by looking at another part of the database or using a separate resource like the NCBI database.

Assuming I know that XIST is on chromosome 17 (chr17), I can then query the features table for seqid='chr17' and featuretype='exon'. The count of such entries should give me the number of exons in XIST.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation table where each gene has its exons. So perhaps relations link genes to their exons. If that's the case, I might need to query the relations table for parent='XIST' and then count how many children are associated with it.

Wait, but if the features table already contains all the exons under 'exon' featuretype, maybe it's simpler to just count those entries where seqid is chr17. That seems more straightforward.

So my SQL query would be something like:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE id='XIST' AND seqid='chr17' AND featuretype='exon';

But I'm not sure if the gene has multiple exons or just one. XIST is a pseudogene, but it's involved in X-inactivation by transcribing an antisense RNA. So maybe it doesn't have any coding exons? Or perhaps it does have some intronic regions?

Wait, no, XIST itself is non-coding, so its featuretype should be 'gene', not exon. The actual exons would be part of other genes or sequences within the chr17 region.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The user asked about the number of exons in XIST gene. Since XIST is a gene, but it's non-coding, perhaps it doesn't have any exons? Or does it?

Wait, no, genes can have intronic regions and sometimes UTRs, but they don't necessarily have exons if they're pseudogenes or non-coding. So maybe the features table for XIST would only have a 'gene' featuretype without any exons.

But that doesn't make sense because genomic regions often have multiple features like exons, introns, etc., even if they are not coding. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps the database includes all possible features on chr17, and XIST is just one of them. So to find how many exons are in XIST's gene, maybe it's part of a larger transcript that has multiple exons elsewhere?

Wait, no, XIST itself doesn't have exons because it's non-coding. Its function comes from an antisense RNA. So perhaps the number of exons for XIST is zero.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check another source or think about how the database stores this information.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant to ask about a gene that has multiple exons and wants to know how many exons are present in general for genes on chr17. But no, the question specifically is about XIST.

So perhaps the correct answer is zero because XIST doesn't have any coding exons.

The number of exons in the XIST gene is 0. This is because XIST is a non-coding RNA gene and does not contain any coding exons; it functions through an antisense RNA rather than through its own exons.
