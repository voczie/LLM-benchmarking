Okay, so I need to figure out how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has using a SQLite database that contains genome annotation data. The database schema includes tables like features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates. 

First, I should understand what each table represents. The 'features' table seems to hold general information about genomic features, including things like their ID, sequence ID, source, type, start and end positions, etc. Since we're interested in transcripts, the feature type would be 'transcript'. So, I'll need to query this table where featuretype is 'transcript' and the id is 'XIST'.

But wait, maybe there are multiple isoforms of XIST. Each isoform might have a different ID or just share some attributes but differ in other ways like start or end positions. The problem mentions that each transcript isoform should be identified by its 'transcript_name', which I assume corresponds to the id field.

So, my initial thought is to select all records from the features table where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST'. But wait, maybe XIST can have multiple entries with different attributes but same or similar IDs. Or perhaps each isoform has a unique ID? I'm not entirely sure, so I should check.

Looking at the schema, there's also a 'relations' table which links features to other things, possibly parent-child relationships. But for this question, maybe it's not necessary unless XIST is part of a larger structure that needs to be considered.

Wait, perhaps each isoform has its own unique ID within the 'features' table. So, if I run a query selecting id where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST', how many rows will I get? If it's more than one, then there are multiple isoforms.

But maybe XIST can have different transcript names based on their start or end positions. For example, one might be the primary transcript, another a processed version with an exon skipped or added. So, each would have a different id but same featuretype and id? Or perhaps they share the same id but differ in other fields.

Wait, no, I think each isoform is represented by its own unique ID within the 'features' table. So, if XIST has multiple isoforms, there should be multiple entries with id='XIST' and featuretype='transcript'.

So, my plan is to write a SQL query that selects all records from the features table where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST'. Then, I'll count how many rows are returned. Each row represents an isoform.

Once I have that list, I also need to print the transcript name (which would be the id) and the size of each. The size probably refers to the length of the transcript, which might be stored in a field like 'length' or maybe it's calculated from start and end positions.

Wait, looking back at the schema, there's no 'length' column mentioned. So perhaps I need to calculate it using end - start + 1? Or maybe the 'score' field is used for something else. Alternatively, maybe the length isn't directly stored but can be derived from other fields like start and end.

So, in my query, after selecting the id, I should also compute the size as (end - start + 1). But wait, looking at the schema again, there's a 'start' and 'end' field. So yes, each transcript has a start and end position, so the length can be calculated.

But perhaps the 'score' is something else, maybe for alternative splicing or other features. Not sure. Maybe it's not needed here.

So, putting it all together, I'll write a query that selects id (as transcript_name), and calculates the size as (end - start + 1) from the features table where featuretype is 'transcript' and id is 'XIST'. Then, group by id to ensure each isoform is counted once.

Wait, but if XIST has multiple entries with the same id, that would be a problem. So perhaps I should use DISTINCT on the id field in the SELECT clause to get unique transcript names.

Alternatively, maybe each isoform has a different id, so no need for DISTINCT. But just to be safe, including DISTINCT might help avoid counting duplicates if any exist by mistake.

So, my query would look something like:

SELECT DISTINCT id AS transcript_name, (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id = 'XIST';

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact column names. The schema says 'start int', 'end int'. So yes, end and start are present.

Alternatively, perhaps the length is stored in another field like 'length', but since it's not mentioned, I'll proceed with calculating it from start and end.

Another thing to consider: if XIST has multiple entries, each will be a separate row. So, after running the query, I can see how many rows there are for XIST, which tells me the number of isoforms.

Once I have that list, I can then present the transcript names and their sizes.

Wait, but in the initial answer provided, the user included a step where they used 'transcript_name' as an alias. So perhaps the id is not exactly the same as the transcript name, or maybe it's better to use the id as the transcript name since that's what was asked.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct query would be:

SELECT id AS transcript_name, (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id = 'XIST';

But wait, maybe XIST is part of a larger structure where each isoform has its own relation. So perhaps I should also consider the relations table to see how many children are linked under XIST.

Alternatively, if XIST is an annotation in the features table and each isoform is represented as a separate entry with id='XIST', then counting them would suffice.

I think that's the approach.

To determine the number of transcript isoforms for the XIST gene along with their sizes, follow these steps:

1. **Query the Features Table**: Extract all records where the feature type is 'transcript' and the ID is 'XIST'. This will give you each isoform.

2. **Calculate Isoform Sizes**: Compute the size of each transcript using its start and end positions (end - start + 1).

3. **List Isoforms**: Present each isoform's ID (as transcript name) and its calculated size.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT id AS transcript_name, 
       (end - start + 1) AS size
FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND id = 'XIST';
```

This query will return each isoform of XIST with its corresponding size.
