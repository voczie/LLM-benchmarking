Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the sizes of each gene locus for specific genes using a SQLite database that contains genome annotation data. The user provided a schema for their database tables, which includes features, relations, meta, directives, autoincrements, and duplicates.

First, I should understand what each table represents. The 'features' table seems to hold all the genomic annotations, including information like gene start and end positions. The 'relations' table probably links these features, maybe indicating parent-child relationships or something similar. The other tables (meta, directives, autoincrements, duplicates) don't seem directly relevant for this task, so I can focus on the 'features' and 'relations' tables.

The user wants to calculate the sizes of each gene locus separately for a list of genes: XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, COL1A2, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB. I'm assuming "locus size" refers to the length of the genomic region that defines the locus, which is typically from the start of the gene (exon 1) to the end of the gene (last exon). So for each gene, I need to find the maximum end position across all its exons.

Looking at the 'features' table, it has a 'start' and 'end' field. For genes, these would correspond to the beginning and end positions of the gene locus. However, sometimes genes have introns and multiple exons, so if there are multiple exons for a gene, I need to find the maximum 'end' value among all exons.

But wait, in the 'features' table, does each exon have its own entry? Or is it possible that some features might not be exons but other parts of the genome? Since we're dealing with genes, perhaps each feature corresponds to an exon. But I'm not entirely sure without more context. If a gene has multiple exons, they would all be present in the 'features' table as separate entries.

So, for each gene, I need to find its start and end positions. The size of the locus would then be (end - start + 1), accounting for both inclusive endpoints.

Now, how do I get this information from the database? I can write a SQL query that selects the 'start' and 'end' fields for each gene, calculates the size, and groups by gene name. But wait, in the 'features' table, is there an identifier for each gene besides just being part of a feature? Or do I need to join with another table?

Wait, looking at the schema again, the 'features' table has an 'id' field which is the primary key. So perhaps each row represents a specific genomic feature (like an exon), and each feature has attributes like name, source, etc.

But in this case, we're interested in genes named XIST, MALAT1, etc., so I need to find all features where the 'name' field matches these gene names. However, looking at the schema, there's no 'name' column in the 'features' table. Hmm, that might be a problem.

Wait, maybe each feature has an 'attributes' field which contains information like 'gene_id', 'transcript_id', etc. So perhaps I can parse the 'attributes' field to extract the gene name or gene ID for each feature.

Alternatively, if the 'features' table includes a 'name' column, that would make it easier, but since it's not in the schema provided, I have to work with what's available.

So, assuming that the 'features' table has an 'attributes' field where each feature's attributes are stored as a text string. For example, for a gene exon, the attributes might include something like "gene_id XIST; transcript_id ...", etc.

Therefore, in my SQL query, I can select from the 'features' table where the 'name' is one of the specified genes by parsing the 'attributes' field.

But how do I extract the name from the attributes? The 'attributes' field is a text type, so it's a string that contains key-value pairs separated by semicolons. For example, "gene_id XIST; transcript_id MALAT1; ...".

So, to get the gene name for each feature, I can split the 'attributes' string on semicolons and look for the 'gene_id' part.

Alternatively, if there's a specific column that holds this information, but since it's not in the schema, perhaps we have to work with what's available.

Wait, maybe the 'features' table has an 'id' field which is unique per feature. So each gene might have multiple features (exons), each identified by their own 'id'. But without a way to link these to the gene name, it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'features' table includes a 'gene_id' column that I missed in the schema. Let me check again: no, the schema provided doesn't include a 'name' or 'gene_id' field. So maybe each feature is an exon, and for each exon, we can get its gene name from the attributes.

So, perhaps my approach should be:

1. For each of the specified genes (XIST, MALAT1, etc.), find all features where the 'attributes' contain a 'gene_id' equal to that gene.

2. For each such feature, record the start and end positions.

3. For each gene, calculate the maximum end position across all its exons.

4. The size of the locus is (max_end - min_start + 1), but wait, no—each exon has a start and end, so for the entire gene, it's from the minimum start to the maximum end? Or perhaps just take the first exon's start and last exon's end?

Wait, actually, in genomic data, each gene is represented by its locus, which starts at the beginning of the first exon and ends at the end of the last exon. So for a gene with multiple exons, the size would be from the earliest start to the latest end.

But if I'm only interested in the size of the locus per gene, perhaps it's sufficient to take the minimum start across all exons and the maximum end across all exons for that gene, then calculate (max_end - min_start + 1).

Alternatively, maybe each feature is a single exon, so for each gene, I can find its first exon's start and last exon's end.

But without knowing how many exons each gene has, it's hard to say. So perhaps the best approach is to get all features where 'gene_id' matches one of the specified genes, then for each such feature, note their start and end positions, and compute the size as (end - start + 1) for each exon, but since we need the locus size, it's better to find the overall span.

Wait, no. The locus is defined by the gene's start and end, which are typically at the beginning of the first exon and the end of the last exon. So perhaps I can get all features where 'gene_id' matches one of the genes, then for each such feature, note their start and end positions, find the minimum start across all exons (which would be the gene's start), and the maximum end across all exons (gene's end). Then size is max_end - min_start + 1.

But how do I get 'gene_id' from the 'attributes'? Since the schema doesn't include a 'gene_id' field, perhaps it's stored in the 'name' field. Wait, no—looking back at the user's question, they provided the schema and asked for guidance on calculating sizes of each gene locus.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the 'features' table includes an 'id' which is unique per feature (like per exon), but without a way to link it to the gene name, perhaps we can assume that each gene has only one feature? That doesn't make sense because genes have multiple exons.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to consider each feature as part of the same gene if they share certain attributes. But again, without 'gene_id' in the schema, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the schema:

CREATE TABLE features (
    id text,
    seqid text,
    source text,
    featuretype text,
    start int,
    end int,
    score text,
    strand text,
    attributes text,
    ... )

Ah! The 'attributes' field is present, which likely contains metadata about each feature. So perhaps for each exon (feature), the 'attributes' include a 'gene_id' or similar.

So, to get all exons of a particular gene, I can query the 'features' table where 'attributes' contain 'gene_id XIST', etc.

But how? Because in SQL, you can't directly parse strings like that unless you have specific functions. In PostgreSQL, for example, you can use split functions or regular expressions to extract parts from the attributes string.

So perhaps my approach is:

For each gene (XIST, MALAT1, etc.), I need to find all features where 'attributes' contain a key-value pair with 'gene_id' equal to that gene. Then, for each such feature, get their start and end positions. Then, compute the locus size as max(end) - min(start) + 1.

But wait, perhaps it's simpler: if I can find all features where 'attributes' contain a 'name' field matching one of the genes, then take those features' start and end to compute the locus.

Wait, but without knowing how the attributes are structured, this is tricky. For example, maybe each feature has an 'id' that corresponds to its gene, like 'gene_id XIST'.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that for each of these genes, there is exactly one feature in the 'features' table where the 'name' field matches (e.g., "name XIST"), and then take that feature's start and end.

But this might not be accurate because a gene can have multiple features (exons), so perhaps it's better to collect all features for each gene, find their min start and max end, and compute the size accordingly.

So, putting this together, here's how I would structure the query:

1. For each of the specified genes, select all features where 'attributes' contain a key-value pair that identifies them as part of that gene (e.g., 'gene_id XIST').

2. For each such feature, record its start and end positions.

3. For each gene, find the minimum start position across all its exons and the maximum end position.

4. The size is then max_end - min_start + 1.

But how to extract 'gene_id' from 'attributes'? Since in SQL, you can't directly parse a string like that unless you have specific functions or regular expressions.

In PostgreSQL, for example, you could use something like:

SELECT * FROM features WHERE attributes LIKE '%gene_id XIST%';

Or perhaps split the attributes string into key-value pairs and look for 'gene_id'.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, if the schema includes a 'gene_id' column that I missed earlier, but according to the provided schema, it doesn't.

Wait, looking back at the user's initial message: they provided the schema as:

CREATE TABLE features (
    id text,
    seqid text,
    source text,
    featuretype text,
    start int,
    end int,
    score text,
    strand text,
    attributes text,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

So, no 'gene_id' field. Therefore, I have to work with the 'attributes' string.

In that case, perhaps for each gene, I can query all features where the 'attributes' contain a key-value pair like 'gene_id XIST'.

But in SQL, how do you extract this? One way is to use a regular expression match.

For example:

SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%gene_id XIST%';

This would select all features where the attributes string contains 'gene_id XIST' as one of its key-value pairs.

Similarly for other genes.

Then, for each such feature, I can get their start and end positions. Then, for each gene, collect all these starts and ends, find min(start) and max(end), and compute size.

But this approach would require running multiple queries (one per gene) to collect all the exons' start and end points.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to create a subquery that selects all features where 'attributes' contain any of the specified gene IDs, then aggregate their min(start) and max(end).

Wait, but how do I know which gene each feature belongs to? Because without a 'gene_id' field in the table, I can't directly link them.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: for each of the genes, create a separate query that selects all features where 'attributes' contain their name as a key-value pair (e.g., "name XIST"), then compute min(start) and max(end).

But again, without knowing how the attributes are structured, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to assume that each feature corresponds to a single gene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's simpler than that. Perhaps for each of these genes, there is exactly one feature in the 'features' table where their name matches (e.g., "name XIST"), and then we can take that feature's start and end positions as the locus.

But this might not be accurate because a gene can have multiple exons, so perhaps it's better to collect all features for each gene and compute min(start) and max(end).

So, putting this together, here's how I would write the SQL query:

For each gene in the list (XIST, etc.), select all features where 'attributes' contain a key-value pair that identifies them as part of that gene. Then, for each such feature, get their start and end positions. For each gene, compute min(start) and max(end), then calculate size = max_end - min_start + 1.

But in SQL, how do I extract the 'gene_id' from the attributes string? Let's assume that the attributes are structured as key-value pairs separated by commas, like "key1=value1,key2=value2".

So, for example, an attribute string might be "name=XIST,gene_id=XXX".

In that case, to extract 'gene_id XIST', I can use a regular expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the attributes field contains something like "gene_id XIST" as part of it. So, using a LIKE clause with '%' allows us to match any string containing that substring.

So, for each gene, say XIST, the query would be:

SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

But wait, this might not work because 'attributes' could contain other fields as well. For example, if a feature has an attribute like "name=XIST,name=XYZ", then using LIKE '%XIST%' would match both.

Alternatively, perhaps the attributes field contains exactly one key-value pair per feature, so that for each feature, there's only one key=value in 'attributes'.

If that's the case, then we can use a regular expression to extract the value of a specific key. For example:

SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%gene_id = XIST%';

This would select all features where the attributes string contains 'gene_id = XIST' as one of its key-value pairs.

But in SQL, this requires that the attribute field is treated as a string and we can search within it. So, for example, in PostgreSQL, you could use:

SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f->attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

Wait, no, because 'attributes' is a text column; perhaps using a substring match.

Alternatively, if the attributes are stored as JSON objects (which they might be), then we can parse them into key-value pairs and extract the desired value. But since in the provided schema, 'attributes' is just a text field, I think it's safer to assume that each feature has one key-value pair per gene.

But perhaps this approach is getting too complicated for someone who may not have experience with string parsing in SQL.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to use an OR condition for each gene. For example:

SELECT f.* FROM features f
WHERE (f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%') 
OR (f.attributes LIKE '%MALAT1%')
OR ... and so on for each gene.

But this would require listing all genes in the WHERE clause, which is feasible but not scalable if there are many genes.

Alternatively, perhaps we can create a list of gene names and loop through them, but that's more of a procedural approach rather than a SQL query.

Given that, perhaps it's better to proceed with selecting each feature where 'attributes' contains their name as part of the key-value pair.

So, for example:

For XIST:
SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

Similarly for MALAT1, etc.

But then, this would return all features that have any attribute mentioning XIST, which might not be correct if a feature has multiple attributes. For instance, a feature could have both 'name=XIST' and another attribute like 'gene_id=XXX'.

In such cases, the query above would still match because it's looking for '%XIST%' in the attributes string.

But perhaps this is acceptable given the problem statement.

Once I have all these features for each gene, then I can extract their start and end positions.

Then, for each gene, compute min(start) as min_start and max(end) as max_end. The size would be max_end - min_start + 1.

So, putting this into a SQL query:

For XIST:
SELECT MIN(f.start), MAX(f.end) FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

Similarly for each gene.

But wait, in SQL, you can't have subqueries that aggregate like this directly. So perhaps I need to write separate queries for each gene.

Alternatively, if the user is okay with multiple queries, they could run one per gene.

So, summarizing:

1. For each gene (XIST, MALAT1, etc.), write a SELECT statement that finds the minimum start and maximum end of all features where 'attributes' contains that gene's name as part of their attributes.

2. Then, compute size = max_end - min_start + 1 for each gene.

But perhaps this is getting too detailed. Maybe I should provide an example query.

Alternatively, maybe using a subquery to get the min and max:

SELECT 
    MIN(f.start) AS min_start,
    MAX(f.end) AS max_end
FROM 
    features f
WHERE 
    f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%';

Then compute size as (max_end - min_start + 1).

But again, this requires two separate queries: one to get the min and max.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Common Table Expression (CTE):

WITH gene_features AS (
    SELECT f.* FROM features f WHERE f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%'
)
SELECT 
    MIN(gf.start) AS min_start,
    MAX(gf.end) AS max_end
FROM gene_features gf;

But this would require writing a separate CTE for each gene, which is not efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps using a parameterized approach with arrays:

But given the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with the initial plan.

So, in conclusion, the SQL query would involve selecting all features where 'attributes' contains the gene name as part of their attributes, then computing min(start) and max(end), and finally calculating the size.
</think>

To determine the locus (start and end positions) for each specified gene based on their attributes in the `features` table, we can use SQL queries to extract the necessary information. Here's how you can approach it:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify Relevant Features**: For each gene (e.g., XIST), find all records where the `attributes` field contains that gene name as part of a key-value pair.

2. **Extract Start and End Positions**: From these relevant features, extract the minimum start position (`min_start`) and maximum end position (`max_end`).

3. **Calculate Locus Size**: Compute the size of the locus using the formula: `size = max_end - min_start + 1`.

### SQL Query

```sql
-- For each gene, find its locus in the features table
WITH feature_data AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(f.start) AS min_start,
        MAX(f.end) AS max_end
    FROM 
        features f
    WHERE 
        f.attributes LIKE '%XIST%'  -- Replace 'XIST' with your gene name
)
SELECT 
    feature_data.min_start,
    feature_data.max_end,
    (feature_data.max_end - feature_data.min_start + 1) AS locus_size
FROM 
    feature_data;
```

### Explanation

- **WITH Clause**: This is used to create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `feature_data`. It selects the minimum start and maximum end positions from all features where the gene name appears in the attributes.

- **WHERE Clause**: Filters features based on whether their `attributes` field contains the specified gene name. The `%XIST%` acts as a wildcard to match any substring containing 'XIST'.

- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the computed minimum start, maximum end, and calculates the locus size by subtracting min_start from max_end and adding 1 (to include both endpoints).

### Example for Each Gene

For each gene like XIST, MALAT1, etc., you would replace `'XIST%'` in the WHERE clause with the respective gene name prefixed with a `%`, e.g.:

```sql
-- For MALAT1
WITH feature_data AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(f.start) AS min_start,
        MAX(f.end) AS max_end
    FROM 
        features f
    WHERE 
        f.attributes LIKE '%MALAT1%'
)
SELECT 
    feature_data.min_start,
    feature_data.max_end,
    (feature_data.max_end - feature_data.min_start + 1) AS locus_size
FROM 
    feature_data;
```

This approach efficiently isolates the relevant features for each gene and computes their genomic locus.
