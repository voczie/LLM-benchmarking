To determine how many genes for miRNA exist on chromosome 10 using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite3 database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to count the number of entries where the `featuretype` is 'gene', the `seqid` is '10', and the `attributes` field contains the information indicating that the gene is of type 'miRNA'.

3. **Count the Results**: You can sum the results that match the criteria.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to perform this task:

```python
import sqlite3
import json

# Connect to the SQLite database
db = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# Query to count miRNA genes on chromosome 10
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND seqid = '10' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype=miRNA%'
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the result
miRNA_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the result
print(f"Number of miRNA genes on chromosome 10: {miRNA_count}")

# Close the database connection
db.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **Cursor**: A cursor object is created to execute SQL commands.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where:
  - `featuretype` is 'gene'
  - `seqid` is '10'
  - The `attributes` field contains 'gene_biotype=miRNA' (using `LIKE` to match the string).
- **Fetch Result**: The result of the count is fetched using `fetchone()`.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the count of miRNA genes on chromosome 10.
- **Close Connection**: The database connection is closed after the operation.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
