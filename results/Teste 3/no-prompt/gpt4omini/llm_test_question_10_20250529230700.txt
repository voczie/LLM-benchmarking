To find the chromosomal position of the BRCA1 gene using the SQLite3 database that contains the genome annotation in GFF/GTF format, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite3 database where the genome annotations are stored.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to find the entry corresponding to the BRCA1 gene. The relevant fields are `seqid`, `start`, and `end`.

3. **Extract the Chromosomal Position**: Once you have the relevant feature, you can extract the chromosomal position using the `start` and `end` fields.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite3 database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to find the BRCA1 gene
query = """
SELECT seqid, start, end 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%BRCA1%'
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Check if the result is found and print the chromosomal position
if result:
    seqid, start, end = result
    print(f"Chromosomal position of BRCA1: {seqid}:{start}-{end}")
else:
    print("BRCA1 gene not found.")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite3 database using the `sqlite3` library.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the `seqid`, `start`, and `end` fields from the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'gene' and the `attributes` contain 'BRCA1'.
- **Fetching Results**: The `fetchone()` method retrieves the first matching record.
- **Output**: If a record is found, it prints the chromosomal position in the format `seqid:start-end`. If not, it indicates that the BRCA1 gene was not found.
- **Closing Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
