To determine how many transcript isoforms the XIST gene has and to print the transcript isoform names along with their sizes, you can follow these steps using Python and the SQLite3 database containing your genome annotation data.

Here's a step-by-step guide along with the code:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, you need to connect to your SQLite3 database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query for the XIST Gene**: You will need to find the transcripts associated with the XIST gene. This typically involves querying the `features` table for entries where the `featuretype` is 'transcript' and the `attributes` contain the gene name 'XIST'.

3. **Calculate Sizes**: For each transcript, calculate the size by subtracting the start coordinate from the end coordinate and adding 1 (to account for inclusive counting).

4. **Print Results**: Finally, print the transcript names and their sizes.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

# Query to find all transcript isoforms for the XIST gene
query = """
SELECT id, start, end, attributes 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name=XIST%'
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all results
transcripts = cursor.fetchall()

# Initialize a count for the number of isoforms
count = 0

# Print the transcript names and sizes
for transcript in transcripts:
    transcript_id = transcript[0]
    start = transcript[1]
    end = transcript[2]
    attributes = transcript[3]

    # Extract transcript_name from attributes
    # Assuming attributes are in the format: "key1=value1;key2=value2;..."
    attr_dict = dict(item.split("=") for item in attributes.split(";") if "=" in item)
    transcript_name = attr_dict.get('transcript_name', 'Unknown')

    # Calculate size
    size = end - start + 1

    # Print the transcript name and size
    print(f"Transcript name: {transcript_name}, Size: {size} bp")
    
    # Increment the count
    count += 1

# Print the total number of transcript isoforms
print(f"\nThe XIST gene has {count} transcript isoforms.")

# Close the database connection
db_connection.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the `id`, `start`, `end`, and `attributes` fields from the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'transcript' and the `attributes` contain 'gene_name=XIST'.
- **Fetching Results**: The results are fetched and iterated over.
- **Attribute Parsing**: The attributes are parsed to extract the `transcript_name`.
- **Size Calculation**: The size of each transcript is calculated and printed.
- **Count**: The total number of transcript isoforms is counted and printed at the end.
- **Closing Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
