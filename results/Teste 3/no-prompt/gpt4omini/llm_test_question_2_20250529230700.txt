To determine how many lncRNA genes are on chromosome 7 using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite3 database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to count the number of features that are classified as lncRNA genes on chromosome 7.

3. **Filter by Feature Type and Attributes**: Since you are interested in lncRNA genes, you will filter for features of type 'gene' and check the `attributes` field for the `gene_biotype` that indicates it is an lncRNA.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:

```python
import sqlite3
import json

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to count lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '7'
AND json_extract(attributes, '$.gene_biotype') = 'lncRNA';
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)
lncRNA_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the result
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {lncRNA_count}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where:
  - `featuretype` is 'gene'
  - `seqid` is '7' (indicating chromosome 7)
  - The `attributes` field contains a JSON object where the `gene_biotype` is 'lncRNA'. The `json_extract` function is used to access the `gene_biotype` attribute.
- **Fetch and Print Result**: The result is fetched using `fetchone()` and printed.
- **Close Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This code will give you the count of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7.
