To determine how many genes and transcripts are present on chromosome 3 using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, ensure you have a connection to your SQLite3 database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to count the number of entries for genes and transcripts specifically for chromosome 3.

3. **Count the Features**: Use SQL queries to count the number of genes and transcripts.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to count genes on chromosome 3
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = '3'")
genes_chr3 = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Query to count transcripts on chromosome 3
cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'transcript' AND seqid = '3'")
transcripts_chr3 = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the results
print(f"Genes on chromosome 3: {genes_chr3}")
print(f"Transcripts on chromosome 3: {transcripts_chr3}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **Counting Genes**: The first SQL query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where `featuretype` is 'gene' and `seqid` is '3'.
- **Counting Transcripts**: The second SQL query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where `featuretype` is 'transcript' and `seqid` is '3'.
- **Fetching Results**: The results are fetched using `fetchone()`, which retrieves the first row of the result set.
- **Output**: Finally, the counts are printed to the console.
- **Closing Connection**: The database connection is closed to free up resources.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This code will give you the number of genes and transcripts on chromosome 3 as requested.
