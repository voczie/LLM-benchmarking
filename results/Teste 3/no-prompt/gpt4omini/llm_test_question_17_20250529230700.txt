To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation data, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, you need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to retrieve the gene features located on the X chromosome. Specifically, you will want to select the `start` and `end` fields for features of type 'gene'.

3. **Calculate Gene Sizes**: For each gene, calculate its size by subtracting the `start` coordinate from the `end` coordinate and adding 1 (to account for inclusive counting).

4. **Generate the Scatterplot**: Use a plotting library like Matplotlib to create the scatterplot.

Hereâ€™s a complete example in Python:

```python
import sqlite3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Connect to the SQLite3 database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 2: Query the database for gene features on the X chromosome
query = """
SELECT start, end FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND seqid = 'X'
"""
cursor.execute(query)

# Step 3: Calculate gene sizes
gene_sizes = []
for start, end in cursor.fetchall():
    gene_size = end - start + 1  # Calculate gene size
    gene_sizes.append(gene_size)

# Step 4: Generate the scatterplot
plt.scatter(range(len(gene_sizes)), gene_sizes)
plt.xlabel('Gene Index')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
plt.show()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the `start` and `end` fields from the `features` table where the `featuretype` is 'gene' and the `seqid` is 'X'.
- **Gene Size Calculation**: For each gene retrieved, the size is calculated and stored in the `gene_sizes` list.
- **Scatterplot Creation**: The scatterplot is created using Matplotlib, where the x-axis represents the index of the gene and the y-axis represents the size of the gene in base pairs.
- **Closing the Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed to free up resources.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
