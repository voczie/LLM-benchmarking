To answer the question of how many exons each transcript isoform of the BRCA1 gene has, you can follow these steps using Python and the SQLite3 database that contains your GFF/GTF data. Below is a detailed walkthrough along with the code you can use.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the SQLite Database**: First, you need to connect to your SQLite database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query for Exons**: You will need to retrieve all exon features associated with the BRCA1 gene. This can be done by filtering the features based on the `featuretype` and the `gene_name` attribute.

3. **Count Exons per Transcript**: For each exon, you will extract the `transcript_name` and count how many exons correspond to each transcript.

4. **Print Results**: Finally, print the transcript isoform names along with their corresponding exon counts.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the above steps in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')  # Replace with your database name
cursor = db.cursor()

# Dictionary to hold the count of exons for each transcript
brca1_exon_counts = {}

# Query to get all exons related to the BRCA1 gene
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT features.attributes
    FROM features
    WHERE features.featuretype = 'exon'
""")

# Iterate through the results
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    attributes = row[0]
    # Parse the attributes to extract gene_name and transcript_name
    attr_dict = dict(item.split('=') for item in attributes.split(';') if '=' in item)
    
    # Check if the gene_name is BRCA1
    if 'gene_name' in attr_dict and attr_dict['gene_name'] == 'BRCA1':
        transcript_name = attr_dict.get('transcript_name', None)
        if transcript_name:
            # Increment the count of exons for this transcript
            brca1_exon_counts[transcript_name] = brca1_exon_counts.get(transcript_name, 0) + 1

# Print the results
for transcript_name, exon_count in brca1_exon_counts.items():
    print(f"{transcript_name}: {exon_count}")

# Close the database connection
db.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: It retrieves all exon features from the `features` table.
- **Attribute Parsing**: The attributes string is split into key-value pairs to extract `gene_name` and `transcript_name`.
- **Counting Exons**: A dictionary (`brca1_exon_counts`) is used to count the number of exons for each transcript isoform.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the transcript names along with their exon counts.

### Note
Make sure to replace `'your_database_name.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file. Also, ensure that the attribute parsing logic matches the format of your attributes in the database.
