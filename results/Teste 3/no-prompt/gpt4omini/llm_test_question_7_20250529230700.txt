To determine how many exons the XIST gene has using the SQLite3 database containing the genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the XIST Gene**: First, you need to find the ID of the XIST gene in the database. This is typically done by querying the `features` table for the gene type.

2. **Find Exons Associated with the XIST Gene**: Once you have the gene ID for XIST, you can then look for exons that are related to this gene by checking the `relations` table.

3. **Count the Unique Exons**: Finally, you will count the unique exons associated with the XIST gene.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in Python using the SQLite3 database:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = db.cursor()

# Step 1: Find the ID of the XIST gene
cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM features WHERE featuretype = 'gene' AND attributes LIKE '%XIST%'")
xist_gene = cursor.fetchone()

if xist_gene:
    xist_gene_id = xist_gene[0]

    # Step 2: Find all exons associated with the XIST gene
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT child FROM relations 
        WHERE parent = ? AND level = 2
    """, (xist_gene_id,))
    
    exons = cursor.fetchall()

    # Step 3: Count unique exons
    unique_exons = set(exon[0] for exon in exons)
    exon_count = len(unique_exons)

    print(f"The XIST gene has {exon_count} exons.")
else:
    print("XIST gene not found in the database.")

# Close the database connection
db.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database where your genome annotation is stored.
- **Query for XIST Gene**: It queries the `features` table to find the ID of the XIST gene.
- **Query for Exons**: It then queries the `relations` table to find all children (exons) of the XIST gene, where the level is 2 (indicating that these are exons).
- **Count Unique Exons**: It collects the exon IDs into a set to ensure uniqueness and counts them.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of unique exons associated with the XIST gene.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.
