To determine how many pseudogenes are on the X chromosome using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, you need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Query the Features Table**: You will need to query the `features` table to find all entries that correspond to pseudogenes on the X chromosome.

3. **Count the Pseudogenes**: You can filter the results based on the `featuretype` and the `seqid` fields.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite3 database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query to count pseudogenes on the X chromosome
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE seqid = 'X' AND featuretype = 'pseudogene';
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the result
total_pseudogenes = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the result
print(f"Total number of pseudogenes on the X chromosome: {total_pseudogenes}")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query counts the number of records in the `features` table where `seqid` is 'X' and `featuretype` is 'pseudogene'.
- **Execute and Fetch**: The query is executed, and the result is fetched using `fetchone()`, which returns a tuple. The count is accessed using `[0]`.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of pseudogenes found on the X chromosome.
- **Close Connection**: The database connection is closed to free up resources.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This code will give you the count of pseudogenes on the X chromosome as requested.
