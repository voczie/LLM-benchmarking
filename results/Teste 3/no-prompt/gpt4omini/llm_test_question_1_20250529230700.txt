To determine how many protein-coding genes are on chromosome 12 using the SQLite3 database that contains your genome annotation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the SQLite3 Database**: First, you need to establish a connection to your SQLite3 database.

2. **Query the Database**: You will need to query the `features` table to count the number of features that are of type `gene`, located on `seqid` (chromosome) `12`, and have an attribute indicating that they are of the `protein_coding` biotype.

3. **Count the Results**: Finally, you will count the results of your query.

Hereâ€™s a Python code snippet that accomplishes this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite3 database
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')  # Replace with your database name
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

# Define the query to count protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM features 
WHERE featuretype = 'gene' 
AND seqid = '12' 
AND attributes LIKE '%gene_biotype=protein_coding%'
"""

# Execute the query
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the result
protein_coding_gene_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]

# Print the result
print(f"Number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12: {protein_coding_gene_count}")

# Close the database connection
cursor.close()
db_connection.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query counts the number of rows in the `features` table where:
  - `featuretype` is `'gene'`
  - `seqid` is `'12'`
  - The `attributes` field contains the string `gene_biotype=protein_coding`. This is done using the `LIKE` operator to check for the presence of the substring.
- **Execute and Fetch**: The query is executed, and the result is fetched using `fetchone()`, which retrieves the first row of the result set.
- **Output**: Finally, the count is printed, and the database connection is closed.

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name.db'` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.
