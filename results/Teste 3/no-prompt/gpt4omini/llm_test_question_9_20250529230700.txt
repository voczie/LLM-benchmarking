To calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the SQLite3 database that contains the genome annotation in GFF/GTF format, you can follow these steps in Python. The provided code examples give a good starting point, but I'll provide a complete walkthrough for clarity.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Connect to the SQLite Database**: First, you need to connect to your SQLite database where the GFF/GTF data is stored.

2. **Retrieve Exons for BRCA1**: You will query the database to get all exon features that belong to the BRCA1 gene.

3. **Calculate Exon Sizes**: For each exon, calculate its size by subtracting the start coordinate from the end coordinate and adding 1 (to account for inclusive counting).

4. **Compute the Average Exon Size**: Sum the sizes of all exons and divide by the number of exons to get the average size.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
db_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Get all exons for BRCA1
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT start, end, attributes 
    FROM features 
    WHERE featuretype = 'exon' AND attributes LIKE '%gene_name=BRCA1%'
""")
brca1_exons = cursor.fetchall()

# Step 2: Calculate total exon size and count
total_exon_size = 0
num_brca1_exons = len(brca1_exons)

for exon in brca1_exons:
    start, end, attributes = exon
    exon_size = end - start + 1  # Calculate exon size
    total_exon_size += exon_size  # Accumulate total size

# Step 3: Calculate average exon size
if num_brca1_exons > 0:
    average_exon_size = total_exon_size / num_brca1_exons
    print(f"Average exon size of BRCA1 transcript isoforms: {average_exon_size:.2f} bp")
else:
    print("No exons found for BRCA1")

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Database Connection**: The code connects to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the `start`, `end`, and `attributes` fields for all exons where the `attributes` field contains the gene name "BRCA1". The `LIKE` operator is used to match the gene name within the attributes string.
- **Exon Size Calculation**: For each exon, the size is calculated as `end - start + 1`, and the total size is accumulated.
- **Average Calculation**: If there are any exons found, the average size is computed and printed. If no exons are found, a message is printed indicating that.
- **Closing the Connection**: Finally, the database connection is closed to free up resources.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file. This code should give you the average exon size for the BRCA1 transcript isoforms.
