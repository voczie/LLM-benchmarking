To generate a scatterplot representing the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome, we will follow these steps:

1. Connect to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils`.
2. Retrieve all gene features located on the X chromosome.
3. Calculate the size of each gene by subtracting the start coordinate from the end coordinate.
4. Store the gene sizes in a list.
5. Use `matplotlib` to create a scatterplot of the gene sizes.

Here's the complete Python script to accomplish this:

```python
import gffutils
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Step 2: Initialize a list to hold gene sizes
gene_sizes = []

# Step 3: Retrieve gene features on the X chromosome and calculate their sizes
for feature in db.features_of_type('gene'):
    if feature.seqid == 'X':  # Check if the feature is on the X chromosome
        gene_size = feature.end - feature.start + 1  # Calculate gene size
        gene_sizes.append(gene_size)  # Append the size to the list

# Step 4: Generate a scatterplot of gene sizes
plt.scatter(range(len(gene_sizes)), gene_sizes)
plt.xlabel('Gene Index')
plt.ylabel('Gene Size (bp)')
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Sizes on Chromosome X')
plt.grid(True)  # Optional: Add a grid for better readability
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Import Libraries:** We import `gffutils` for database interaction and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
- **Connect to Database:** We create a connection to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`.
- **Initialize List:** We prepare an empty list `gene_sizes` to store the sizes of the genes.
- **Retrieve Features:** We loop through all gene features using `db.features_of_type('gene')` and check if they are located on the X chromosome.
- **Calculate Sizes:** For each gene, we calculate its size using the formula `end - start + 1` and append it to the `gene_sizes` list.
- **Plotting:** Finally, we create a scatterplot using `plt.scatter()` and label the axes and title accordingly.

Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file. This script will visualize the distribution of gene sizes on the X chromosome effectively.
