To calculate the sizes of each gene locus for the specified genes (XIST, MALAT1, BRCA1, COL1A2, NFKB1, NFKB2, REL, RELA, and RELB), we will follow these steps:

1. Connect to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils`.
2. Retrieve the gene features for the specified gene names.
3. Calculate the size of each gene locus using the formula: `size = end - start + 1`.
4. Print the results.

Hereâ€™s the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# List of genes to calculate sizes for
genes_list = ["XIST", "MALAT1", "BRCA1", "COL1A2", "NFKB1", "NFKB2", "REL", "RELA", "RELB"]

# Iterate through each gene name in the list
for gene_name in genes_list:
    # Fetch all gene features from the database
    genes = db.features_of_type('gene', order_by='start')
    gene_found = False
    
    # Search for the specific gene
    for gene in genes:
        # Check if the gene_name matches the current gene's attributes
        if gene_name in gene.attributes.get('gene_name', []):
            # Calculate the size of the gene locus
            size = gene.end - gene.start + 1
            print(f"{gene_name} locus size: {size} bp")
            gene_found = True
            break
    
    # If the gene was not found, print a message
    if not gene_found:
        print(f"Gene {gene_name} not found in the database")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection:** We connect to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`. Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.
- **Gene List:** We define a list of gene names for which we want to calculate the sizes.
- **Gene Retrieval:** We retrieve all gene features using `db.features_of_type('gene', order_by='start')`.
- **Size Calculation:** For each gene, we check if its name matches the current gene in the loop. If it matches, we calculate the size of the gene locus using the formula `size = end - start + 1` and print the result.
- **Error Handling:** If a gene is not found in the database, we print a message indicating that.

### Note:
Make sure you have the `gffutils` library installed and that your database is correctly set up with the relevant gene annotations. Adjust the database path as necessary.
