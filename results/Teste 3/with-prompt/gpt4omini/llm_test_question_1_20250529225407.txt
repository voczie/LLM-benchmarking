To count the number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12 using the `gffutils` library, you can follow the steps outlined in the provided code examples. Below is a structured Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Define a generator expression to filter for protein-coding genes on chromosome 12
genes_chr12 = (
    feature for feature in db.features_of_type('gene')
    if feature.seqid == '12' and feature.attributes.get('gene_biotype', [''])[0] == 'protein_coding'
)

# Count the number of protein-coding genes
num_protein_coding_genes_chr12 = sum(1 for _ in genes_chr12)

# Print the result
print(f"Number of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12: {num_protein_coding_genes_chr12}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Import the gffutils Library**: This library is essential for interacting with GFF/GTF databases.
2. **Connect to the Database**: Replace `'your_database.db'` with the path to your actual database file.
3. **Filter for Protein-Coding Genes**:
   - Use `db.features_of_type('gene')` to retrieve all gene features.
   - Filter these features to include only those on chromosome 12 (`feature.seqid == '12'`) and with a `gene_biotype` of `protein_coding`.
4. **Count the Genes**: The generator expression iterates through the filtered features, and `sum(1 for _)` counts them.
5. **Output the Result**: Finally, the script prints the total count of protein-coding genes on chromosome 12.

Make sure to have the `gffutils` library installed and your database properly set up before running this script.
