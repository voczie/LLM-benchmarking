To calculate the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms using the `gffutils` library, we will follow these steps:

1. Retrieve all exons associated with the BRCA1 gene.
2. Calculate the total size of these exons.
3. Count the number of exons.
4. Compute the average exon size by dividing the total size by the number of exons.

Here's the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Step 1: Get all exons for BRCA1
brca1_exons = list(feature for feature in db.features_of_type('exon')
                   if 'BRCA1' in feature.attributes.get('gene_name', []))

# Step 2: Calculate total exon size and count
total_exon_size = sum(feature.end - feature.start + 1 for feature in brca1_exons)
num_brca1_exons = len(brca1_exons)

# Step 3: Calculate average exon size
if num_brca1_exons > 0:
    average_exon_size = total_exon_size / num_brca1_exons
    print(f"Average exon size of BRCA1 transcript isoforms: {average_exon_size:.2f} bp")
else:
    print("No exons found for BRCA1")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Importing the Library:** We start by importing the `gffutils` library.
- **Connecting to the Database:** We connect to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`. Make sure to replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your database file.
- **Retrieving Exons:** We use a list comprehension to filter and retrieve all exons that belong to the BRCA1 gene. The `gene_name` attribute is checked to ensure we are only getting exons related to BRCA1.
- **Calculating Total Size:** We calculate the total size of the exons by summing the lengths of each exon (calculated as `end - start + 1`).
- **Counting Exons:** We count the number of exons retrieved.
- **Calculating Average Size:** If there are exons found, we compute the average size and print it. If no exons are found, we print a message indicating that.

This script will provide you with the average exon size of the BRCA1 transcript isoforms based on the data in your GFF/GTF database.
