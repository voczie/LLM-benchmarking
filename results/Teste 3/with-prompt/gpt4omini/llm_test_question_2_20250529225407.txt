To determine how many lncRNA genes are present on chromosome 7 using the `gffutils` library, we can follow a straightforward approach. We will create a query that filters the features of type 'gene' based on the specified chromosome and the gene biotype.

Here's a Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the existing GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('path_to_your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Count lncRNA genes on chromosome 7
lncRNA_count = sum(1 for feature in db.features_of_type('gene')
                   if feature.seqid == '7' and feature.attributes.get('gene_biotype', [''])[0] == 'lncRNA')

# Print the result
print(f"Number of lncRNA genes on chromosome 7: {lncRNA_count}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Import the gffutils library**: This is necessary to interact with the GFF/GTF database.
2. **Connect to the database**: Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file.
3. **Count lncRNA genes**:
   - We use a generator expression to iterate over all features of type 'gene'.
   - We filter these features to check if they are located on chromosome '7' and if their `gene_biotype` attribute is 'lncRNA'.
   - The `sum()` function counts how many features meet these criteria.
4. **Print the result**: Finally, we output the count of lncRNA genes found on chromosome 7.

Make sure to have the `gffutils` library installed and the database created from your GFF/GTF file before running this script.
