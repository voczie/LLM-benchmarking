To find the genes located between the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes on both the + and - strands, we can follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes** to get their genomic coordinates and strand information.
2. **Determine the genomic region** between these two genes based on their start and end coordinates.
3. **Query the database** for genes that fall within this region, ensuring they are not HOXC11 or HOXC12 themselves.
4. **Print the results**, including the gene ID, name, and strand.

Here's a Python script using the `gffutils` library to accomplish this:

```python
import gffutils

# Connect to the GFF/GTF database
db = gffutils.FeatureDB('your_database.db', keep_order=True)

# Step 1: Find HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes
hoxc11 = next(gene for gene in db.features_of_type('gene') if gene.attributes.get('gene_name', [''])[0] == 'HOXC11')
hoxc12 = next(gene for gene in db.features_of_type('gene') if gene.attributes.get('gene_name', [''])[0] == 'HOXC12')

# Step 2: Determine the region between HOXC11 and HOXC12
start = min(hoxc11.start, hoxc12.start)
end = max(hoxc11.end, hoxc12.end)
chromosome = hoxc11.seqid  # Assuming both genes are on the same chromosome

# Step 3: Find genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12
genes_between = []
for gene in db.features_of_type('gene'):
    if (gene.seqid == chromosome and
        start < gene.start < end and
        gene.id not in [hoxc11.id, hoxc12.id]):
        gene_id = gene.id
        gene_name = gene.attributes.get('gene_name', [''])[0]
        gene_strand = gene.strand
        genes_between.append((gene_id, gene_name, gene_strand))

# Step 4: Print the results
print("Genes between HOXC11 and HOXC12:")
for gene_id, gene_name, gene_strand in genes_between:
    if gene_name:
        print(f"Gene ID: {gene_id}, Gene Name: {gene_name}, Strand: {gene_strand}")
    else:
        print(f"Gene ID: {gene_id}, Strand: {gene_strand}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Database Connection**: The script connects to the GFF/GTF database using `gffutils.FeatureDB()`.
- **Gene Retrieval**: It retrieves the HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes using a generator expression that filters by gene name.
- **Region Calculation**: The start and end coordinates are determined to define the genomic region of interest.
- **Gene Filtering**: It iterates through all genes in the database, checking if they fall within the defined region and are not HOXC11 or HOXC12.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the IDs, names, and strands of the genes found between HOXC11 and HOXC12.

Make sure to replace `'your_database.db'` with the actual path to your GFF/GTF database file.
